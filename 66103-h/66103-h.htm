<p>The preparation of the ensuing pages
has been a labour of love, and has cost me
many an anxious hour. “Of the writing of
books,” says the learned Psalmist (or more
probably a Syro-Chaldæic scribe of the third
century) “there is no end”; and truly it is a
very solemn thought that so many writers,
furnishing the livelihood of so many publishers,
these in their turn supporting so
many journals, reviews and magazines, and
these last giving bread to such a vast army of
editors, reviewers, and what not&mdash;I say it is
a very solemn thought that this great mass
of people should be engaged upon labour of
this nature; labour which, rightly applied,
might be of immeasurable service to humanity,
but which is, alas! so often diverted
into useless or even positively harmful
channels: channels upon which I could
write at some length, were it not necessary
for me, however, to bring this reflection to
a close.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span></p>

<p>A fine old Arabic poem&mdash;probably the
oldest complete literary work in the world&mdash;(I
mean the Comedy which we are accustomed
to call the Book of Job)<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> contains
hidden away among its many treasures the
phrase, “Oh! that mine enemy had written
a book!” This craving for literature, which
is so explicable in a primitive people, and
the half-savage desire that the labour of
writing should fall upon a foeman captured
in battle, have given place in the long process
of historical development to a very
different spirit. There is now, if anything,
a superabundance of literature, and an
apology is needed for the appearance of
such a work as this, nor, indeed, would it
have been brought out had it not been imagined
that Lambkin’s many friends would
give it a ready sale.</p>

<p>Animaxander, King of the Milesians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
upon being asked by the Emissary of
Atarxessus what was, in his opinion, the
most wearying thing in the world, replied
by cutting off the head of the messenger,
thus outraging the religious sense of a time
to which guests and heralds were sacred,
as being under the special protection of
Ζεύς (pronounced “Tsephs”).</p>

<p>Warned by the awful fate of the sacrilegious
monarch, I will put a term to these
opening remarks. My book must be its
own preface, I would that the work could
be also its own publisher, its own bookseller,
and its own reviewer.</p>

<p>It remains to me only to thank the many
gentlemen who have aided me in my task
with the loan of letters, scraps of MSS.,
portraits, and pieces of clothing&mdash;in fine,
with all that could be of interest in illustrating
Lambkin’s career. My gratitude is
especially due to Mr. Binder, who helped in
part of the writing; to Mr. Cook, who was
kind enough to look over the proofs; and to
Mr. Wallingford, Q.C., who very kindly
consented to receive an advance copy. I
must also thank the Bishop of Bury for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
courteous sympathy and ever-ready suggestion;
I must not omit from this list M.
Hertz, who has helped me with French,
and whose industry and gentlemanly manners
are particularly pleasing.</p>

<p>I cannot close without tendering my
thanks in general to the printers who have
set up this book, to the agencies which
have distributed it, and to the booksellers,
who have put it upon their shelves; I feel
a deep debt of gratitude to a very large
number of people, and that is a pleasant
sensation for a man who, in the course of a
fairly successful career, has had to give
(and receive) more than one shrewd knock.</p>

<p class="cd">INTRODUCTORY</p>


<p>It is without a trace of compunction or
regret that I prepare to edit the few unpublished
essays, sermons and speeches of my
late dear friend, Mr. Lambkin. On the
contrary, I am filled with a sense that my
labour is one to which the clearest interests
of the whole English people call me, and I
have found myself, as the work grew under
my hands, fulfilling, if I may say so with
due modesty, a high and noble duty. I remember
Lambkin himself, in one of the last
conversations I had with him, saying with
the acuteness that characterised him, “The
world knows nothing of its greatest men.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
This pregnant commentary upon human
affairs was, I admit, produced by an accident
in the <i>Oxford Herald</i> which concerned myself.
In a description of a Public Function
my name had been mis-spelt, and though I
was deeply wounded and offended, I was
careful (from a feeling which I hope is common
to all of us) to make no more than the
slightest reference to this insult.</p>

<p>The acute eye of friendship and sympathy,
coupled with the instincts of a scholar and
a gentleman, perceived my irritation, and in
the evening Lambkin uttered the memorable
words that I have quoted. I thanked
him warmly, but, if long acquaintance had
taught him my character, so had it taught
me his. I knew the reticence and modesty
of my colleague, the almost morbid fear that
vanity (a vice which he detested) might be
imputed to him on account of the exceptional
gifts which he could not entirely
ignore or hide; and I was certain that the
phrase which he constructed to heal my
wound was not without some reference to
his own unmerited obscurity.</p>

<p>The world knows nothing of its greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
men! Josiah Lambkin! from whatever
Cypress groves of the underworld which
environs us when on dark winter evenings
in the silence of our own souls which nothing
can dissolve though all attunes to that
which nature herself perpetually calls us,
always, if we choose but to remember, your
name shall be known wherever the English
language and its various dialects are spoken.
The great All-mother has made me the
humble instrument, and I shall perform my
task as you would have desired it in a style
which loses half its evil by losing all its
rhetoric; I shall pursue my way and turn
neither to the right nor to the left, but go
straight on in the fearless old English
fashion till it is completed.</p>

<p>Josiah Abraham Lambkin was born of
well-to-do and gentlemanly parents in Bayswater<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
on January 19th, 1843. His father,
at the time of his birth, entertained objections
to the great Public Schools, largely
founded upon his religious leanings, which
were at that time opposed to the ritual of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
those institutions. In spite therefore of the
vehement protestations of his mother (who
was distantly connected on the maternal
side with the Cromptons of Cheshire) the
boy passed his earlier years under the able
tutorship of a Nonconformist divine, and
later passed into the academy of Dr.
Whortlebury at Highgate.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Of his school-days he always spoke with
some bitterness. He appears to have
suffered considerably from bullying, and
the Headmaster, though a humane, was a
blunt man, little fitted to comprehend the
delicate nature with which he had to deal.
On one occasion the nervous susceptible lad
found it necessary to lay before him a
description of the treatment to which he
had been subjected by a younger and
smaller, but much stronger boy; the pedagogue’s
only reply was to flog Lambkin
heartily with a light cane, “inflicting,” as
he himself once told me, “such exquisite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
agony as would ever linger in his memory.”
Doubtless this teacher of the old school
thought he was (to use a phrase then common)
“making a man of him,” but the
object was not easily to be attained by
brutal means. Let us be thankful that
these punishments have nearly disappeared
from our modern seminaries.</p>

<p>When Josiah was fifteen years of age, his
father, having prospered in business, removed
to Eaton Square and bought an
estate in Surrey. The merchant’s mind,
which, though rough, was strong and acute,
had meanwhile passed through a considerable
change in the matter of religion; and
as the result of long but silent self-examination
he became the ardent supporter of a
system which he had formerly abhorred.
It was therefore determined to send the lad
to one of the two great Universities, and
though Mrs. Lambkin’s second cousins, the
Crumptons, had all been to Cambridge,
Oxford was finally decided upon as presenting
the greater social opportunities at the
time.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Here, then, is young Lambkin, in his
nineteenth year, richly but soberly dressed,
and eager for the new life that opens before
him. He was entered at Burford College
on October the 15th, 1861; a date which is,
by a curious coincidence, exactly thirty-six
years, four months, and two days from the
time in which I pen these lines.</p>

<p>Of his undergraduate career there is little
to be told. Called by his enemies “The
Burford Bounder,” or “dirty Lambkin,” he
yet acquired the respect of a small but
choice circle who called him by his own
name. He was third <i>proxime accessit</i> for
the Johnson prize in Biblical studies, and
would undoubtedly have obtained (or been
mentioned for) the Newdigate, had he not
been pitted against two men of quite exceptional
poetic gifts&mdash;the present editor
of “The Investor’s Sure Prophet,” and Mr.
Hound, the well-known writer on “Food
Statistics.”</p>

<p>He took a good Second-class in Greats in
the summer of 1864, and was immediately
elected to a fellowship at Burford. It was
not known at the time that his father had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
become a bankrupt through lending large
sums at a high rate of interest to a young
heir without security, trusting to the
necessity under which his name and honour
would put him to pay. In the shipwreck
of the family fortunes, the small endowment
was a veritable godsend to Josiah,
who but for this recognition of his merits
would have been compelled to work for his
living.</p>

<p>As it was, his peculiar powers were set
free to plan his great monograph on “Being,”
a work which, to the day of his death, he
designed not only to write but to publish.</p>

<p>There was not, of course, any incident of
note in the thirty years during which he
held his fellowship. He did his duty
plainly as it lay before him, occasionally
taking pupils, and after the Royal Commission,
even giving lectures in the College
hall. He was made Junior Dean in October,
1872, Junior Bursar in 1876, and Bursar in
1880, an office which he held during the
rest of his life.</p>

<p>In this capacity no breath of calumny
ever touched him. His character was spotless.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
He never offered or took compensations
of any kind, and no one has hinted
that his accounts were not accurately and
strictly kept.</p>

<p>He never allowed himself to be openly a
candidate for the Wardenship of the College,
but it is remarkable that he received one
vote at each of the three elections held in
the twenty years of his residence.</p>

<p>He passed peacefully away just after Hall
on the Gaudy Night of last year. When
his death was reported, an old scout, ninety-two
years of age, who had grown deaf in
the service of the College, burst into tears
and begged that the name might be more
clearly repeated to him, as he had failed to
catch it. On hearing it he dried his eyes, and
said he had never known a better master.</p>

<p>His character will, I think, be sufficiently
evident in the writings which I shall publish.
He was one of nature’s gentlemen;
reticent, just, and full of self-respect. He
hated a scene, and was careful to avoid
giving rise even to an argument. On the
other hand, he was most tenacious of his
just rights, though charitable to the deserving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
poor, and left a fortune of thirty-five
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>In the difficult questions which arise from
the superior rank of inferiors he displayed
a constant tact and judgment. It is not
always easy for a tutor to control and guide
the younger members of the aristocracy
without being accused of pitiless severity
on the one hand or of gross obsequiousness
on the other. Lambkin, to his honour, contrived
to direct with energy and guide
without offence the men upon whom England’s
greatness depends.</p>

<p>He was by no means a snob&mdash;snobbishness
was not in him. On the other hand, he
was equally removed from what is almost
worse than snobbishness&mdash;the morbid terror
of subservience which possesses some ill-balanced
minds.</p>

<p>His attitude was this: that we are compelled
to admit the aristocratic quality of
the English polity and should, while
decently veiling its cruder aspects, enjoy
to the full the benefits which such a constitution
confers upon society and upon our
individual selves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>By a genial observance of such canons he
became one of the most respected among
those whom the chances of an academic
career presented to him as pupils or parents.
He was the guest and honoured friend of
the Duke of Cumberland, the Duke of
Pembroke, the Duke of Limerick (“Mad
Harry”), and the Duke of Lincoln; he
had also the honour of holding a long conversation
with the Duke of Berkshire, whom
he met upon the top of an omnibus in Piccadilly
and instantly recognised. He possessed
letters, receipts or communications
from no less than four Marquises, one Marquess,
ten Barons, sixteen Baronets and one
hundred and twenty County Gentlemen. I
must not omit Lord Grumbletooth, who
had had commercial dealings with his
father, and who remained to the end of
his life a cordial and devoted friend.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>His tact in casual conversation was no
less remarkable than his general <i>savoir faire</i>
in the continuous business of life. Thus
upon one occasion a royal personage happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
to be dining in Hall. It was some
days after the death of Mr. Hooligan, the
well-known Home Rule leader. The distinguished
guest, with perhaps a trifle of
licence, turned to Lambkin and said “Well,
Mr. Bursar, what do you think of Hooligan?”
We observed a respectful silence and wondered
what reply Lambkin would give in
these difficult circumstances. The answer
was like a bolt from the blue, “De mortuis
nil nisi bonum,” said the Classical Scholar,
and a murmur of applause went round the
table.</p>

<p>Indeed his political views were perhaps
the most remarkable feature in a remarkable
character. He died a convinced and
staunch Liberal Unionist, and this was the
more striking as he was believed by all his
friends to be a Conservative until the introduction
of Mr. Gladstone’s famous Bill in
1885.</p>

<p>In the delicate matter of religious controversy
his own writings must describe him,
nor will I touch here upon a question which
did not rise to any considerable public importance
until after his death. Perhaps I may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
be permitted to say this much; he was a
sincere Christian in the true sense of the
word, attached to no narrow formularies, but
following as closely as he could the system
of Seneca, stiffened (as it were) with the
meditations of Marcus Aurelius, though he
was never so violent as to attempt a practice
of what that extreme stoic laid down in
theory.</p>

<p>Neither a ritualist nor a low-churchman,
he expressed his attitude by a profound and
suggestive silence. These words only escaped
him upon one single occasion. Let
us meditate upon them well in the stormy
discussions of to-day: “Medio tutissimus
ibis.”</p>

<p>His learning and scholarship, so profound
in the dead languages, was exercised with
singular skill and taste in the choice he
made of modern authors.</p>

<p>He was ignorant of Italian, but thoroughly
conversant with the French classics, which
he read in the admirable translations of the
‘Half-crown Series.’ His principal reading
here was in the works of Voltaire,
wherein, however, he confessed, “He could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
find no style, and little more than blasphemous
ribaldry.” Indeed, of the European
languages he would read German with the
greatest pleasure, confining himself chiefly
to the writings of Lessing, Kant, and Schiller.
His mind acquired by this habit a singular
breadth and fecundity, his style a kind of
rich confusion, and his speech (for he was
able to converse a little in that idiom) was
strengthened by expressions of the deepest
philosophic import; a habit which gave him
a peculiar and individual power over his
pupils, who mistook the Teutonic gutturals
for violent objurgations.</p>

<p>Such was the man, such the gentleman,
the true ‘Hglaford,’ the modern ‘Godgebidden
Eorldemanthingancanning,’ whose
inner thoughts shall unroll themselves in
the pages that follow.</p>

<p class="cd">Some Remarks on Lambkin’s Prose
Style</p>


<p>No achievement of my dear friend’s produced
a greater effect than the English
Essay which he presented at his examination.
That so young a man, and a man
trained in such an environment as his,
should have written an essay at all was
sufficiently remarkable, but that his work
should have shown such mastery in the
handling, such delicate balance of idea, and
so much know-ledge (in the truest sense of
the word), coupled with such an astounding
insight into human character and contemporary
psychology, was enough to warrant
the remark of the then Warden of Burford:
“If these things” (said the aged but eminent
divine), “if these things” (it was said
in all reverence and with a full sense of the
responsibility of his position), “If these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
things are done in the green wood, what
will be done in the dry?”</p>

<p>Truly it may be said that the Green
Wood of Lambkin’s early years as an Undergraduate
was worthily followed by the
Dry Wood of his later life as a fellow and
even tutor, nay, as a Bursar of his college.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to add much to the
reader’s own impressions of this <i>tour de
force</i>, or to insist too strongly upon the skill
and breadth of treatment which will at
once make their mark upon any intelligent
man, and even upon the great mass of
the public. But I may be forgiven if I give
some slight personal memories in interpretation
of a work which is necessarily presented
in the cold medium of type.</p>

<p>Lambkin’s hand-writing was flowing and
determined, but was often difficult to read,
a quality which led in the later years
of his life to the famous retort made by the
Rural Dean of Henchthorp to the Chaplain
of Bower’s Hall.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> His manuscript was,
like Lord Byron’s (and unlike the famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
Codex V in the Vatican), remarkable for its
erasures, of which as many as three may be
seen in some places super-imposed, ladderwise,
<i>en échelle</i>, the one above the other,
perpendicularly to the line of writing.</p>

<p>This excessive fastidiousness in the use
of words was the cause of his comparatively
small production of written work; and thus
the essay printed below was the labour of
nearly three hours. His ideas in this
matter were best represented by his little
epigram on the appearance of Liddell and
Scott’s larger Greek Lexicon. “Quality
not quantity” was the witty phrase which he
was heard to mutter when he received his
first copy of that work.</p>

<p>The nervous strain of so much anxiety
about his literary work wearied both mind
and body, but he had his reward. The
scholarly aptitude of every particle in the
phrase, and the curious symmetry apparent
in the great whole of the essay are due to a
quality which he pushed indeed to excess, but
never beyond the boundary that separates
Right and Wrong; we admire in the product
what we might criticise in the method,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
and when we judge as critics we are compelled
as Englishmen and connoisseurs to
congratulate and to applaud.</p>

<p>He agreed with Aristotle in regarding
lucidity as the main virtue of style. And
if he sometimes failed to attain his ideal in
this matter, the obscurity was due to none
of those mannerisms which are so deplorable
in a Meredith or a Browning, but rather
to the fact that he found great difficulty in
ending a sentence as he had begun it. His
mind outran his pen; and the sentence
from his University sermon, “England
must do her duty, or what will the harvest
be?” stirring and patriotic as it is, certainly
suffers from some such fault, though I cannot
quite see where.</p>

<p>The Oxymoron, the Aposiopesis, the
Nominativus Pendens, the Anacoluthon and
the Zeugma he looked upon with abhorrence
and even with dread. He was a friend to all
virile enthusiasm in writing but a foe to
rhetoric, which (he would say) “Is cloying
even in a demagogue, and actually nauseating
in the literary man.” He drew a distinction
between <i>eloquence</i> and rhetoric, often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
praising the one and denouncing the other
with the most abandoned fervour: indeed, it
was his favourite diversion in critical conversation
accurately to determine the meaning
of words. In early youth he would
often split an infinitive or end a sentence
with a preposition. But, ever humble and
ready to learn, he determined, after reading
Mrs. Griffin’s well-known essays in the
<i>Daily American</i>, to eschew such conduct for
the future; and it was a most touching sight
to watch him, even in extreme old age, his
reverend white locks sweeping the paper
before him and his weak eyes peering close
at the MSS. as he carefully went over his
phrases with a pen, scratching out and
amending, at the end of his day’s work, the
errors of this nature.</p>

<p>He commonly used a gilt “J” nib,
mounted upon a holder of imitation ivory,
but he was not cramped by any petty limitations
in such details and would, if necessity
arose, make use of a quill, or even of a
fountain pen, insisting, however, if he was
to use the latter, that it should be of the best.</p>

<p>The paper upon which he wrote the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
that remains to us was the ordinary ruled
foolscap of commerce; but this again he regarded
as quite unimportant. It was the
matter of what he wrote that concerned
him, not (as is so often the case with lesser
men) the mere accidents of pen or paper.</p>

<p>I remember little else of moment with regard
to his way of writing, but I make no
doubt that these details will not be without
their interest; for the personal habits of a
great man have a charm of their own. I
read once that the sum of fifty pounds was
paid for the pen of Charles Dickens. I wonder
what would be offered for a similar
sacred relic, of a man more obscure, but indirectly
of far greater influence; a relic
which I keep by me with the greatest reverence,
which I do not use myself, however
much at a loss I may be for pen or pencil,
and with which I never, upon any account,
allow the children to play.</p>

<p>But I must draw to a close, or I should
merit the reproach of lapsing into a sentimental
peroration, and be told that I am
myself indulging in that rhetoric which
Lambkin so severely condemned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On “Success:” its causes and results</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulty of
Subject</div>

<p>In approaching a problem of
this nature, with all its anomalies
and analogues, we are at once struck by
the difficulty of conditioning any accurate
estimate of the factors of the solution of the
difficulty which is latent in the very terms
of the above question. We shall do well
perhaps, however, to clearly differentiate
from its fellows the proposition we have to
deal with, and similarly as an inception of
our analysis to permanently fix the definitions
and terms we shall be talking of, with,
and by.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Definition of
Success</div>

<p>Success may be defined as the
<i>Successful Consummation of an
Attempt</i> or more shortly as the <i>Realisation
of an imagined Good</i>, and as it implies
Desire or the Wish for a thing, and at the
same time action or the attempt to get at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
thing,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> we might look at Success from yet
another point of view and say that <i>Success
is the realisation of Desire through
action</i>. Indeed this last definition seems
on the whole to be the best; but it is evident
that in this, as in all other matters, it
is impossible to arrive at perfection, and
our safest definition will be that which is
found to be on the whole most approximately
the average mean<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of many hundreds
that might be virtually constructed
to more or less accurately express the idea
we have undertaken to do.</p>

<p>So far then it is evident that while we
may have a fairly definite subjective visual
concept of what Success is, we shall never
be able to convey to others in so many
words exactly what our idea may be.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Method of
dealing with
Problem</div>

<p>It is, however, of more practical
importance nevertheless, to arrive
at some method or other by which
we can in the long run attack the very
serious problem presented to us. Our best
chance of arriving at any solution will lie
in attempting to give objective form to
what it is we have to do with. For this purpose
we will first of all divide all actions into
(א) Successful and (ב) Non-successful<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> actions.
These two categories are at once mutually
exclusive and collectively universal. Nothing
of which Success can be truly predicated,
can at the same time be called with
any approach to accuracy Unsuccessful;
and similarly if an action finally result in
Non-success, it is quite evident that to
speak of its “Success” would be to trifle
with words and to throw dust into our own
eyes, which is a fatal error in any case. We
have then these two primary catēgories
what is true of one will, with certain reservations,
be untrue of the other, in most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
cases (we will come to that later) and <i>vice-versâ</i>.</p>

<p>
(1) Success.<br />
(2) Non-success.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">First great
Difficulty</div>

<p>But here we are met at the outset
of our examination by a difficulty
of enormous dimensions. There is
not one success; there are many. There
is the success of the Philosopher, of the
Scientist, of the Politician, of the Argument,
of the Commanding Officer, of the
Divine, of the mere unthinking Animal
appetite, and of others more numerous
still. It is evident that with such a
vast number of different subsidiary catēgories
within our main catēgory it would be
impossible to arrive at any absolute conclusions,
or to lay down any firm general
principle. For the moment we had erected
some such fundamental foundation the fair
structure would be blown to a thousand
atoms by the consideration of some fresh
form, aspect or realisation, of Success which
might have escaped our vision, so that
where should we be then? It is therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
most eminently a problem in which we
should beware of undue generalisations and
hasty dogmatism. We must abandon here as
everywhere the immoral and exploded cant
of mediæval deductive methods invented by
priests and mummers to enslave the human
mind, and confine ourselves to what we absolutely
<i>know</i>. Shall we towards the end of
this essay truly <i>know</i> anything with regard
to Success? Who can tell! But at least
let us not cheat ourselves with the axioms,
affirmations and dogmas which are, in a
certain sense, the ruin of so many; let us,
if I may use a metaphor, “abandon the <i>à
priori</i> for the <i>chiaro-oscuro</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second much
greater Difficulty</div>

<p>But if the problem is complex
from the great variety of the
various kinds of Success, what
shall we say of the disturbance introduced
by a new aspect of the matter, which we
are now about to allude to! Aye! What
indeed! An aspect so widespread in its
consequences, so momentous and so fraught
with menace to all philosophy, so big with
portent, and of such threatening aspect to
humanity itself, that we hesitate even to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
bring it forward!<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> <i>Success is not always
Success: Non-success (or Failure) is an aspect
of Success, and vice-versâ.</i> This apparent
paradox will be seen to be true on a little
consideration. For “Success” in any one
case involves the “Failure” or “Non-success”
of its opposite or correlative.
Thus, if we bet ten pounds with one of our
friends our “Success” would be his “Non-success,”
and <i>vice-versâ</i>, collaterally. Again,
if we desire to fail in a matter (<i>e.g.</i>, any
man would hope to fail in being hanged<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>),
then to succeed is to fail, and to fail
is to succeed, and our successful failure
would fail were we to happen upon a disastrous
success! And note that the <i>very
same act</i>, not this, that, or another, but
<span class="allsmcap">THE VERY SAME</span>, is (according to the
way we look at it) a “successful” or an
“unsuccessful” act. Success therefore not
only <i>may</i> be, but <i>must</i> be Failure, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
two catēgories upon which we had built
such high hopes have disappeared for ever!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Solemn considerations
consequent
upon this</div>

<p>Terrible thought! A thing
can be at once itself and not itself&mdash;nay
its own opposite! The
mind reels, and the frail human vision
peering over the immense gulf of metaphysical
infinity is lost in a cry for mercy
and trembles on the threshold of the unseen!
What visions of horror and madness may
not be reserved for the too daring soul which
has presumed to knock at the Doors of
Silence! Let us learn from the incomprehensible
how small and weak a thing is man!
</p>

<div class="sidenote">A more cheerful
view</div>
<p>
But it would ill-befit the philosopher
to abandon his effort because
of a kind of a check or two at the start.
The great hand of Time shouts ever “onward”;
and even if we cannot discover the
Absolute in the limits of this essay, we may
rise from the ashes of our tears to better
and happier things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The beginning
of a Solution</div>

<p>A light seems to dawn on us.
We shall not arrive at the full
day but we shall see “in a glass darkly”
what, in the final end of our development,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
may perhaps be more clearly revealed to us.
It is evident that we have been dealing
with a relative. <i>How</i> things so apparently
absolute as hanging or betting can be in
any true sense relative we cannot tell, because
we cannot conceive the majestic whole
of which Success and Failure, plus and
minus, up and down, yes and no, truth and
lies, are but as the glittering facets of a
diamond borne upon the finger of some
titled and wealthy person.</p>

<p>Our error came from foolish self-sufficiency
and pride. We thought (forsooth)
that our mere human conceptions of contradiction
were real. It has been granted
to us (though we are but human still), to
discover our error&mdash;there is no hot or cold,

<p class="cd">Lambkin on Sleep</p>


<p>[<i>This little gem was written for the great
Monograph on “Being,” which Lambkin never
lived to complete. It was included, however,
in his little volume of essays entitled “Rictus
Almae Matris.” The careful footnotes, the
fund of information, and the scholarly accuracy
of the whole sketch are an example&mdash;(alas! the
only one)&mdash;of what his full work would have
been had he brought it to a conclusion. It is an
admirable example of his manner in maturer
years.</i>]</p>

<p>In sleep our faculties lie dormant.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> We
perceive nothing or almost nothing of our
surroundings; and the deeper our slumber
the more absolute is the barrier between
ourselves and the outer world. The causes
of this “Cessation of Consciousness” (as it
has been admirably called by Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
M‘Obvy)<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> lie hidden from our most profound
physiologists. It was once my
privilege to meet the master of physical
science who has rendered famous the University
of Kreigenswald,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and I asked him
what in his opinion was the cause of sleep.
He answered, with that reverence which is
the glory of the Teutonic mind, “It is in
the dear secret of the All-wise Nature-mother
preserved.” I have never forgotten
those wise and weighty words.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the nearest guess as to the nature
of Sleep is to be discovered in the lectures
of a brilliant but sometimes over-daring
young scholar whom we all applaud in the
chair of Psychology. “Sleep” (he says)
“is the direct product of Brain Somnolence,
which in its turn is the result of the need
for Repose that every organism must experience
after any specialised exertion.” I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
was present when this sentence was delivered,
and I am not ashamed to add that
I was one of those who heartily cheered the
young speaker.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>We may assert, then, that Science has
nearly conquered this last stronghold of
ignorance and superstition.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>As to the Muses, we know well that Sleep
has been their favourite theme for ages.
With the exception of Catullus (whose
verses have been greatly over-rated, and
who is always talking of people lying
awake at night), all the ancients have
mentioned and praised this innocent pastime.
Everyone who has done Greats
will remember the beautiful passage in
Lucretius,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but perhaps that in Sidonius
Apollinaris, the highly polished Bishop of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Gaul, is less well known.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> To turn to our
own literature, the sonnet beginning “To
die, to sleep,” etc.,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> must be noted, and
above all, the glorious lines in which
Wordsworth reaches his noblest level, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is a pleasant thing to go to sleep!”</p>
</div>

<p>lines which, for my part, I can never read
without catching some of their magical
drowsy influence.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>All great men have slept. George III.
frequently slept,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and that great and good
man Wycliffe was in the habit of reading
his Scriptural translations and his own
sermons nightly to produce the desired
effect.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The Duke of Wellington (whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
my father used to call “The Iron Duke”)
slept on a little bedstead no larger than a
common man’s.</p>

<p>As for the various positions in which one
may sleep, I treat of them in my little book

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Advice to Freshmen</p>


<p>Mr. Lambkin possessed among other
great and gracious qualities the habit of
writing to his nephew, Thomas Ezekiel
Lambkin,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who entered the college as an
undergraduate when his uncle was some
four years a Fellow. Of many such communications
he valued especially this which
I print below, on account of the curious and
pathetic circumstances which surrounded it.
Some months after Thomas had been given
his two groups and had left the University,
Mr. Lambkin was looking over some books
in a second-hand book shop&mdash;not with the
intention of purchasing so much as to improve
the mind. It was a favourite habit of
his, and as he was deeply engaged in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
powerful romance written under the pseudonym
of “Marie Corelli”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> there dropped
from its pages the letter which he had sent
so many years before. It lay in its original
envelope unopened, and on turning to the
flyleaf he saw the name of his nephew
written. It had once been his! The boy
had so treasured the little missive as to
place it in his favourite book!</p>

<p>Lambkin was so justly touched by the
incident as to purchase the volume, asking
that the price might be entered to his account,
which was not then of any long standing.
The letter he docketed “to be published
after my death.” And I obey the
wishes of my revered friend:</p>

<p class="i1">
“<span class="smcap">My Dear Thomas</span>,<br />
</p>

<p><span class="i2">“Here you are at last in Oxford, and
at Burford, ‘a Burford Man.’ How proud
your mother must be and even your father,
whom I well remember saying that ‘if he
were not an accountant, he would rather be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
a Fellow of Burford than anything else on
earth.’ But it was not to be.</span></p>

<p>“The life you are entering is very different
from that which you have left behind. When
you were at school you were under a strict
discipline, you were compelled to study the
classics and to play at various games.
Cleanliness and truthfulness were enforced
by punishment, while the most instinctive
habits of decency and good manners could
only be acquired at the expense of continual
application. In a word, ‘you were a child
and thought as a child.’</p>

<p>“Now all that is changed, you are free
(within limits) to follow your own devices,
to make or mar yourself. But if you use
Oxford aright she will make you as she
has made so many of your kind&mdash;a perfect
gentleman.</p>

<p>“But enough of these generalities. It is
time to turn to one or two definite bits of
advice which I hope you will receive in the
right spirit. My dear boy, I want you to
lay your hand in mine while I speak to you,
not as an uncle, but rather as an elder
brother. Promise me three things. First<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
never to gamble in any form; secondly,
never to drink a single glass of wine after
dinner; thirdly, never to purchase anything
without paying for it in cash. If you will
make such strict rules for yourself and keep
them religiously you will find after years of
constant effort a certain result developing
(as it were), you will discover with delight
that your character is formed; that you have
neither won nor lost money at hazards, that
you have never got drunk of an evening,
and that you have no debts. Of the first
two I can only say that they are questions
of morality on which we all may, and all <i>do</i>,
differ. But the third is of a vital and practical
importance. Occasional drunkenness
is a matter for private judgment, its rightness
or wrongness depends upon our ethical
system; but debt is fatal to any hope of
public success.</p>

<p>“I hesitate a little to mention one further
point; but&mdash;may I say it?&mdash;will you do
your best to avoid drinking neat spirits in
the early morning&mdash;especially Brandy? Of
course a Governor and Tutor, whatever his
abilities, gets removed in his sympathies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
from the younger men.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The habit may
have died out, and if so I will say no more,
but in my time it was the ruin of many a
fair young life.</p>

<p>“Now as to your day and its order.
First, rise briskly when you are called, and
into your cold bath, you young dog!<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> No
shilly-shally; into it. Don’t splash the
water about in a miserable attempt to deceive
your scout, but take an Honest British
Cold Bath like a man. Soap should never
be used save on the hands and neck. As to
hot baths, never ask for them in College, it
would give great trouble, and it is much
better to take one in the Town for a shilling;
nothing is more refreshing than a good hot
bath in the Winter Term.</p>

<p>“Next you go out and ‘keep’ a Mosque,
Synagogue, or Meeting of the Brethren,
though if you can agree with the system it
is far better to go to your College Chapel;
it puts a man right with his superiors and
you obey the Apostolic injunction.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Then comes your breakfast. Eat as
much as you can; it is the foundation of a
good day’s work in the Vineyard. But
what is this?&mdash;a note from your Tutor.
Off you go at the appointed time, and as
you may be somewhat nervous and diffident
I will give you a little Paradigm,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> as it
were, of a Freshman meeting his Tutor for
the first time.</p>

<p>“[<i>The Student enters, and as he is half
way through the door says:&mdash;</i>]</p>

<p>“<i>St.</i>&mdash;Good morning! Have you noticed
what the papers say about&mdash;[<i>Here mention
some prominent subject of the day.</i>]</p>

<p>“[<i>The Tutor does not answer but goes on
writing in a little book; at last he looks up
and says:&mdash;</i>]</p>

<p>“<i>Tut.</i>&mdash;Pray, what is your name?</p>

<p>“<i>St.</i>&mdash;M. or N.</p>

<p>“<i>Tut.</i>&mdash;What have you read before coming
up, Mr. ⸺?</p>

<p>“<i>St.</i>&mdash;The existing Latin authors from
Ennius to Sidonius Apollinaris, with their
fragments. The Greek from Sappho to
Origen including Bacchylides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>[<i>The Tutor makes a note of this and resumes....</i>]</p>

<p>“<i>Tut.</i>&mdash;Have you read the Gospels?</p>

<p>“<i>St.</i>&mdash;No, Sir.</p>

<p>“<i>Tut.</i>&mdash;You must read two of them as soon
as possible in the Greek, as it is necessary to
the passing of Divinity, unless indeed you
prefer the beautiful work of Plato. Come
at ten to-morrow. Good morning.</p>

<p>“<i>St.</i>&mdash;I am not accustomed to being
spoken to in that fashion.</p>

<p>[<i>The Tutor will turn to some other Student,
and the first Student will leave the room.</i>]</p>

<p>“I have little more to say. You will soon
learn the customs of the place, and no words
of mine can efficiently warn you as experience
will. Put on a black coat before Hall,
and prepare for that meal with neatness, but
with no extravagant display. Do not wear
your cap and gown in the afternoon, do not
show an exaggerated respect to the younger
fellows (except the Chaplain), on the one
hand, nor a silly contempt for the older Dons
upon the other. The first line of conduct is
that of a timid and uncertain mind; it is of
no profit for future advancement, and draws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
down upon one the contempt of all. The
second is calculated to annoy as fine a body
of men as any in England, and seriously to
affect your reputation in Society.</p>

<p>“You will find in every college some club
which contains the wealthier undergraduates
and those of prominent position. Join it if
possible at once before you are known. At
its weekly meetings speak soberly, but not
pompously. Enliven your remarks with
occasional flashes of humour, but do not
trench upon the ribald nor pass the boundary
of right-reason. Such excesses may
provoke a momentary laugh, but they ultimately
destroy all respect for one’s character.
Remember Lot’s wife!</p>

<p>“You will row, of course, and as you
rush down to the river after a hurried lunch
and dash up to do a short bit of reading before
Hall, your face will glow with satisfaction
at the thought that every day of your
life will be so occupied for four years.</p>

<p>“Of the grosser and lower evils I need
not warn you: you will not give money to
beggars in the street, nor lend it to your
friends. You will not continually expose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
your private thoughts, nor open your heart
to every comer in the vulgar enthusiasm of
some whom you may meet. No, my dear
Ezekiel, it would be unworthy of your name,
and I know you too well, to fear such things
of you. You are a Gentleman, and that you
may, like a gentleman, be always at your ease,
courteous on occasion, but familiar never, is
the earnest prayer of&mdash;</p>

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Lecture on “Right”</p>


<p>Of the effects of Mr. Lambkin’s lectures,
the greatest and (I venture to think) the
most permanent are those that followed
from his course on <i>Ethics</i>. The late Dean
of Heaving-on-the-Marsh (the Honourable
Albert Nathan-Merivale, the first name
adopted from his property in Rutland) told
me upon one occasion that he owed the
direction of his mind to those lectures (under
Providence) more than to any other
lectures he could remember.</p>

<p>Very much the same idea was conveyed
to me, more or less, by the Bishop of Humbury,
who turned to me in hall, only a year
ago, with a peculiar look in his eyes, and
(as I had mentioned Lambkin’s name) said
suddenly, like a man who struggles with an
emotion:<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> “Lambkin(!)<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> ... did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
he give lectures in your hall ... on
Ethics?” “Some,” I replied, “were given
in the Hall, others in Lecture Room No. 2
over the glory-hole.” His lordship said
nothing, but there was a world of thought
and reminiscence in his eyes. May we not&mdash;knowing
his lordship’s difficulties in
matters of belief, and his final victory&mdash;ascribe
something of this progressive and
salutary influence to my dear friend?</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">On “Right”</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">[<i>Being Lecture V. in a course of Eight, delivered, in the
Autumn Term of 1878.</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>We have now proceeded for a considerable
distance in our journey towards the
Solution. Of eight lectures, of which I had
proposed to make so many milestones on
the road, the fifth is reached, and now we
are in measurable distance of the Great
Answer; the Understanding of the Relations
of the Particular to the Universal.</p>

<p>It is an easy, though a profitable task to
wander in what the late Sir Reginald
Hawke once called in a fine phrase “the
flowery meads and bosky dells of Positive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Knowledge.” It is in the essence of any
modern method of inquiry that we should
be first sure of our facts, and it is on this
account that all philosophical research
worthy of the name must begin with the
physical sciences. For the last few weeks
I have illustrated my lectures with chemical
experiments and occasionally with large
coloured diagrams, which, especially to
young people like yourselves have done not
a little to enliven what might at first appear
a very dull subject. It is therefore with
happy, hopeful hearts, with sparkling eyes
and eager appetite that we leave the physical
entry-hall of knowledge to approach the
delicious feast of metaphysics.</p>

<p>But here a difficulty confronts us. So far
we have followed an historical development.
We have studied the actions of savages and
the gestures of young children; we have
enquired concerning the habits of sleepwalkers,
and have drawn our conclusions
from the attitudes adopted in special manias.
So far, then, we have been on safe ground.
We have proceeded from the known to the unknown,
and we have correlated Psychology,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Sociology, Anatomy, Morphology, Physiology,
Geography, and Theology (<i>here Mr.
Darkin of Vast, who had been ailing a long
time, was carried out in a faint; Mr. Lambkin,
being short-sighted, did not fully seize
what had happened, and thinking that certain
of his audience were leaving the Hall without
permission, he became as nearly angry as
was possible to such a man. He made a short
speech on the decay of manners, and fell into
several bitter epigrams. It is only just to say
that, on learning the occasion of the interruption,
he regretted the expression “strong meat
for babes” which had escaped him at the
time.</i>)</p>

<p>So far so good. But there is something
more. No one can proceed indefinitely in
the study of Ethics without coming, sooner
or later, upon the Conventional conception
of <i>Right</i>. I do not mean that this conception
has any philosophic value. I should
be the last to lay down for it those futile,
empirical and dogmatic foundations which
may satisfy narrow, deductive minds. But
there it is, and as practical men with it we
must deal. What is <i>Right</i>? Whence proceeds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
this curious conglomeration of idealism,
mysticism, empiricism, and fanaticism
to which the name has been given?</p>

<p>It is impossible to say. It is the duty of
the lecturer to set forth the scheme of truth:
to make (as it were) a map or plan of Epistemology.
He is not concerned to demonstrate
a point; he is not bound to
dispute the attitude of opponents. Let
them fall of their own weight (<i>Ruant mole
suâ</i>). It is mine to show that things <i>may</i>
be thus or thus, and I will most steadily refuse
to be drawn into sterile argument and
profitless discussion with mere affirmations.</p>

<p>“The involute of progression is the
subconscious evolution of the particular
function.” No close reasoner will deny
this. It is the final summing up of all that
is meant by Development. It is the root
formula of the nineteenth century that is
now, alas! drawing to a close under our very
eyes. Now to such a fundamental proposition
I add a second. “The sentiment of
right is the inversion of the subconscious
function in its relation to the indeterminate
ego.” This also I take to be admitted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
all European philosophers in Germany.
Now I will not go so far as to say that
a major premiss when it is absolutely
sound, followed by a minor equally sound,
leads to a sure conclusion. God fulfils
himself in many ways, and there are more
things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than
are dreamt of in your philosophy. But
I take this tentatively: that if these two
propositions are true (and we have the
word of Herr Waldteufel,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> who lives in the
Woodstock Road, that it is true) then it
follows conclusively that no certainty can
be arrived at in these matters. I would
especially recommend you on this point
(<i>here Mr. Lambkin changed his lecturing
voice for a species of conversational, interested
and familiar tone</i>) to read the essay by the
late Dr. Barton in <i>Shots at the Probable</i>:
you will also find the third chapter of Mr.
Mendellsohn’s <i>History of the Soul</i> very
useful. Remember also, by the way, to
consult the footnote on p. 343, of Renan’s
<i>Anti-Christ</i>. The Master of St. Dives’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
<i>Little Journeys in the Obvious</i> is light and
amusing, but instructive in its way.</p>

<p>There is a kind of attitude (<i>this was
Lambkin’s peroration, and he was justly proud
of it</i>) which destroys nothing but creates
much: which transforms without metamorphosis,
and which says “look at this, I
have found truth!” but which dares not
say “look away from that&mdash;it is untrue.”</p>

<p>Such is our aim. Let us make without
unmaking and in this difficult question of
the origin of <i>Right</i>, the grand old Anglo-Saxon
sense of “Ought,” let us humbly
adopt as logicians, but grimly pursue as
practical men some such maxim as what
follows:</p>

<p>“Right came from nothing, it means
nothing, it leads to nothing; with it we
are nothing, but without it we are worse
than nothing.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Next Thursday I shall deal with morality
in international relations.</p>

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Special Correspondence</p>


<p>Lambkin was almost the first of that
great band of Oxford Fellows who go as
special correspondents for Newspapers to
places of difficulty and even of danger. On
the advantages of this system he would
often dilate, and he was glad to see, as he
grew to be an older, a wealthier, and a
wiser man, that others were treading in his
footsteps. “The younger men,” he would
say, “have noticed what perhaps I was the
first to see, that the Press is a Power, and
that men who are paid to educate should
not be ashamed to be paid for any form of
education.” He was, however, astonished
to see how rapidly the letters of a correspondent
could now be issued as a book, and
on finding that such publications were arranged
for separately with the publishers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
and were not the property of the Newspapers,
he expressed himself with a just
warmth in condemnation of such a trick.</p>

<p>“Sir” (said he to the Chaplain), “in
my young days we should have scorned to
have faked up work, well done for a particular
object, in a new suit for the sake
of wealth”; and I owe it to Lambkin’s
memory to say that he did not make a
penny by his “Diary on the Deep,”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in
which he collected towards the end of his
life his various letters written to the Newspapers,
and mostly composed at sea.</p>

<p>The occasion which produced the following
letter was the abominable suppression
by Italian troops of the Catholic Riots at
Rome in 1873. Englishmen of all parties
had been stirred to a great indignation at
the news of the atrocities. “As a nation”
(to quote my dear friend) “we are slow to
anger, but our anger is terrible.” And such
was indeed the case.</p>

<p>A great meeting was held at Hampstead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
in which Mr. Ram made his famous speech.
“This is not a question of religion or of
nationality but of manhood (he had said),
and if we do not give our sympathy freely, if
we do not send out correspondents to inform
us of the truth, if we do not meet in public
and protest, if we do not write and speak
and read till our strength be exhausted, then
is England no longer the England of Cromwell
and of Peel.”</p>

<p>Such public emotion could not fail to
reach Lambkin. I remember his coming to
me one night into my rooms and saying
“George (for my name is George), I had to-day
a letter from Mr. Solomon’s paper&mdash;<i>The
Sunday Englishman</i>. They want me
to go and report on this infamous matter,
and I will go. Do not attempt to dissuade
me. I shall return&mdash;if God spares my life&mdash;before
the end of the vacation. The offer
is most advantageous in every way: I mean
to England, to the cause of justice, and to
that freedom of thought without which there
is no true religion. For, understand me,
that though these poor wretches are Roman
Catholics, I hold that every man should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
have justice, and my blood boils within
me.”</p>

<p>He left me with a parting grip of the
hand, promising to bring me back photographs
from the Museum at Naples.</p>

<p>If the letter that follows appears to be
lacking in any full account of the Italian
army and its infamies, if it is observed to
be meagre and jejune on the whole subject
of the Riots, that is to be explained by the
simple facts that follow.</p>

<p>When Lambkin sailed, the British Fleet
had already occupied a deep and commodious
harbour on the coast of Apulia, and
public irritation was at its height; but by
the time he landed the Quirinal had been
forced to an apology, the Vatican had received
monetary compensation, and the
Piedmontese troops had been compelled to
evacuate Rome.</p>

<p>He therefore found upon landing at Leghorn<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
a telegram from the newspaper, saying
that his services were not required, but
that the monetary engagements entered into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
by the proprietors would be strictly adhered
to.</p>

<p>Partly pleased, partly disappointed,
Lambkin returned to Oxford, taking
sketches on the way from various artists
whom he found willing to sell their productions.
These he later hung round his
room, not on nails (which as he very properly
said, defaced the wall), but from a
rail;&mdash;their colours are bright and pleasing.
He also brought me the photographs I
asked him for, and they now hang in my
bedroom.</p>

<p>This summary must account for the
paucity of the notes that follow, and the
fact that they were never published.</p>

<p>[There was some little doubt as to whether
certain strictures on the First Mate in Mr.
Lambkin’s letters did not affect one of our
best families. Until I could make certain
whether the Estate should be credited
with a receipt on this account or debited
with a loss I hesitated to publish. Mr.
Lambkin left no heirs, but he would have
been the first to regret (were he alive) any
diminution of his small fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>I am glad to say that it has been satisfactorily
settled, and that while all parties
have gained none have lost by the settlement.]</p>

<p>Whatever scruples I might have had in
sending off my first letter before I had left
the Thames, and upon such a day, are
dissipated by the emotions to which the
scenes I have just passed through give
rise.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>What can be more marvellous than this
historic river! All is dark, save where the
electric light on shore, the river-boats’
lanterns on the water, the gas-lamps and
the great glare of the town<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> dispel the
gloom. And over the river itself, the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Tamesis, a profound silence reigns, broken
only by the whistling of the tugs, the hoarse
cries of the bargemen and the merry banjo-party
under the awning of our ship. All is
still, noiseless and soundless: a profound
silence broods over the mighty waters. It
is night.</p>

<p>It is night and silent! Silence and
night! The two primeval things! I
wonder whether it has ever occurred to the
readers of the <i>Sunday Englishman</i> to travel
over the great waters, or to observe in their
quiet homes the marvellous silence of the
night? Would they know of what my
thoughts were full? They were full of
those poor Romans, insulted, questioned
and disturbed by a brutal soldiery, and I
thought of this: that we who go out on a
peculiarly pacific mission, who have only to
write while others wield the sword, we also
do our part. Pray heaven the time may
soon come when an English Protectorate
shall be declared over Rome and the hateful
rule of the Lombard foreigners shall cease.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>There is for anyone of the old viking
blood a kind of fascination in the sea. The
screw is modern, but its vibration is the
very movement of the wild white oars that
brought the Northmen<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to the field of
Senlac.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Now I know how we have dared
and done all. I could conquer Sicily
to-night.</p>

<p>As I paced the deck, an officer passed and
slapped me heartily on the shoulder. It
was the First Mate. A rough diamond but
a diamond none the less. He asked me
where I was bound to. I said Leghorn.
He then asked me if I had all I needed for
the voyage. It seems that I had strayed on
to the part of the deck reserved for the
second-class passengers. I informed him
of his error. He laughed heartily and said
we shouldn’t quarrel about that. I said his
ship seemed to be a Saucy Lass. He answered
“That’s all right,” asked me if I
played “Turn-up Jack,” and left me. It is
upon men like this that the greatness of
England is founded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>Well, I will “turn in” and “go below”
for my watch; “you gentlemen of England”
who read the <i>Sunday Englishman</i>, you little
know what life is like on the high seas;
but we are one, I think, when it comes to the
love of blue water.</p>

<p>
<i>Posted at Dover, Monday, Sept. 28, 1873.</i><br />
</p>

<p>We have dropped the pilot. I have nothing
in particular to write. There is a kind
of monotony about a sea voyage which is
very depressing to the spirits. The sea was
smooth last night, and yet I awoke this
morning with a feeling of un-quiet to which
I have long been a stranger, and which
should not be present in a healthy man. I
fancy the very slight oscillation of the boat
has something to do with it, though the lady
sitting next to me tells me that one only
feels it in steamboats. She said her dear
husband had told her it was “the smell of
the oil”&mdash;I hinted that at breakfast one can
talk of other things.</p>

<p>The First Mate sits at the head of our
table. I do not know how it is, but there
is a lack of <i>social reaction</i> on board a ship.
A man is a seaman or a passenger, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
is an end of it. One has no fixed rank, and
the wholesome discipline of social pressure
seems entirely lost. Thus this morning
the First Mate called me “The Parson,”
and I had no way to resent his familiarity.
But he meant no harm; he is a sterling
fellow.</p>

<p>After breakfast my mind kept running to
this question of the Roman Persecution,
and (I know not how) certain phrases kept
repeating themselves literally “<i>ad nauseam</i>”
in my imagination. They kept pace with
the throb of the steamer, an altogether new
sensation, and my mind seemed (as my old
tutor, Mr. Blurt, would put it) to “work in
a circle.” The pilot will take this. He
is coming over the side. He is not in the
least like a sailor, but small and white. He
wears a bowler hat, and looks more like a
city clerk than anything else. When I
asked the First Mate why this was, he answered
“It’s the Brains that tell.” A very
remarkable statement, and one full of menace
and warning for our mercantile marine.</p>

<p>I cannot properly describe the freshness
and beauty of the sea after a gale. I have
not the style of the great masters of English
prose, and I lack the faculty of expression
which so often accompanies the poetic soul.</p>

<p>The white curling tips (white horses)
come at one if one looks to windward, or if
one looks to leeward seem to flee. There is
a kind of balminess in the air born of the
warm south; and there is jollity in the
whole ship’s company, as Mrs. Burton
and her daughters remarked to me this
morning. I feel capable of anything. When
the First Mate came up to me this morning
and tried to bait me with his vulgar chaff I
answered roundly, “Now, sir, listen to me.
I am not seasick, I am not a landlubber, I
am on my sea legs again, and I would have
you know that I have not a little power to
make those who attack me feel the weight
of my arm.”</p>

<p>He turned from me thoroughly ashamed,
and told a man to swab the decks. The
passengers appeared absorbed in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
various occupations, but I felt I had
“scored a point” and I retired to my cabin.</p>

<p>My steward told me of a group of rocks
off the Spanish coast which we are approaching.
He said they were called “The
Graveyard.” If a man can turn his mind
to the Universal Consciousness and to a
Final Purpose all foolish fears will fall into
a secondary plane. I will not do myself
the injustice of saying that I was affected
by the accident, but a lady or child might
have been, and surely the ship’s servants
should be warned not to talk nonsense to
passengers who need all their strength for
the sea.</p>

<p class="i3">
<i>Friday, Oct. 2, 1873.</i><br />
</p>

<p>To-day I met the Captain. I went up on
the bridge to speak to him. I find his
name is Arnssen. He has risen from the
ranks, his father having been a large haberdasher
in Copenhagen and a town councillor.
I wish I could say the same of the First
Mate, who is the scapegrace son of a great
English family, though he seems to feel no
shame. Arnssen and I would soon become
fast friends were it not that his time is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
occupied in managing the ship. He is just
such an one as makes the strength of our
British Mercantile marine. He will often
come and walk with me on the deck, on
which occasions I give him a cigar, or even
sometimes ask him to drink wine with me.
He tells me it is against the rules for the
Captain to offer similar courtesies to his
guests, but that if ever I am in Ernskjöldj,
near Copenhagen, and if he is not absent on
one of his many voyages, he will gratefully
remember and repay my kindness.</p>

<p>I said to the Captain to-day, putting my
hand upon his shoulder, “Sir, may one
speak from one’s heart?” “Yes,” said he,
“certainly, and God bless you for your kind
thought.” “Sir,” said I, “you are a strong,
silent, God-fearing man and my heart goes
out to you&mdash;no more.” He was silent, and
went up on the bridge, but when I attempted
to follow him, he assured me it was
not allowed.</p>

<p>Later in the day I asked him what he
thought of the Roman trouble. He answered,
“Oh! knock their heads together
and have done with it.” It was a bluff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
seaman’s answer, but is it not what England
would have said in her greatest days? Is
it not the very feeling of a Chatham?</p>

<p>I no longer speak to the First Mate.
But in a few days I shall be able to dismiss
the fellow entirely from my memory, so I
will not dwell on his insolence.</p>

<p class="i3">
<i>Leghorn, Oct. 5, 1873.</i><br />
</p>

<p>Here is the end of it. I have nothing
more to say. I find that the public has no
need of my services, and that England has
suffered a disastrous rebuff. The fleet has
retreated from Apulia. England&mdash;let posterity
note this&mdash;has not an inch of ground
in all the Italian Peninsula. Well, we are
worsted, and we must bide our time; but
this I will say: if that insolent young fool
the First Mate thinks that his family shall
protect him he is mistaken. The press is a
great power and never greater than where
(as in England) a professor of a university
or the upper classes write for the papers,
and where a rule of anonymity gives talent
and position its full weight.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Address to the League of
Progress</p>


<p>Everybody will remember the famous
meeting of the Higher Spinsters in 1868;
a body hitherto purely voluntary in its
organisation, it had undertaken to add
to the houses of the poor and wretched
the element which reigns in the residential
suburbs of our great towns. If Whitechapel
is more degraded now than it was
thirty years ago we must not altogether disregard
the earlier efforts of the Higher
Spinsters, they laboured well each in her
own sphere and in death they were not
divided.</p>

<p>The moment however which gave their
embryonic conceptions an organic form did
not sound till this year of 1868. It was in
the Conference held at Burford during that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
summer that, to quote their eloquent circular,
“the ideas were mooted and the feeling
was voiced which made us what we are.”
In other words the Higher Spinsters were
merged in the new and greater society of
the League of Progress. How much the
League of Progress has done, its final recognition
by the County Council, the sums
paid to its organisers and servants I need
not here describe; suffice it to say that, like
all our great movements, it was a spontaneous
effort of the upper middle class, that it
concerned itself chiefly with the artisans,
whom it desired to raise to its own level,
and that it has so far succeeded as to now
possess forty-three Cloisters in our great
towns, each with its Grand Master, Chatelaine,
Corporation of the Burghers of Progress
and Lay Brothers, the whole supported
upon salaries suitable to their social
rank and proceeding entirely from voluntary
contributions with the exception of
that part of the revenue which is drawn
from public funds.</p>

<p>The subject of the Conference, out of
which so much was destined to grow, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
“The Tertiary Symptoms of Secondary
Education among the Poor.”</p>

<p>Views upon this matter were heard from
every possible standpoint; men of varying
religious persuasions from the Scientific
Agnostic to the distant Parsee lent breadth
and elasticity to the fascinating subject.
Its chemical aspect was admirably described
(with experiments) by Sir Julius Wobble,
the Astronomer Royal, and its theological
results by the Reader in Burmesan.</p>

<p>Lambkin was best known for the simple
eloquence in which he could clothe the
most difficult and confused conceptions. It
was on this account that he was asked to
give the Closing Address with which the
Proceedings terminated.</p>

<p>Before reciting it I must detain the reader
with one fine anecdote concerning this occasion,
a passage worthy of the event and
of the man. Lambkin (as I need hardly
say) was full of his subject, enthusiastic and
absorbed. No thought of gain entered his
head, nor was he the kind of man to have
applied for payment unless he believed
money to be owing to him. Nevertheless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
it would have been impossible to leave unremunerated
such work as that which follows.
It was decided by the authorities to
pay him a sum drawn from the fees which
the visitors had paid to visit the College
Fish-Ponds, whose mediæval use in monkish
times was explained in a popular style
by one who shall be nameless, but who
gave his services gratuitously.</p>

<p>After their departure Mr. Large entered
Lambkin’s room with an envelope, wishing
to add a personal courtesy to a pleasant
duty, and said:</p>

<p>“I have great pleasure, my dear Lambkin,
in presenting you with this Bank Note
as a small acknowledgment of your services
at the Conference.”</p>

<p>Lambkin answered at once with:</p>

<p>“My dear Large, I shall be really displeased
if you estimate that slight performance
of a pleasurable task at so high a rate
as ten pounds.”</p>

<p>Nor indeed was this the case. For when
Lambkin opened the enclosure (having
waited with delicate courtesy for his visitor
to leave the room) he discovered but five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
pounds therein. But note what follows&mdash;Lambkin
neither mentioned the matter to
a soul, nor passed the least stricture upon
Large’s future actions, save in those matters
where he found his colleague justly to blame:
and in the course of the several years during
which they continually met, the restraint
and self-respect of his character
saved him from the use of ignoble weapons
whether of pen or tongue. It was a lesson
in gentlemanly irony to see my friend take
his place above Large at high table in the
uneasy days that followed.</p>


<p class="center">THE ADDRESS</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap i1">My dear Friends</span>,<br />
</p>

<p><span class="i2">I shall attempt to put before you in a
few simple, but I hope well-chosen words,
the views of a plain man upon the great
subject before us to-day. I shall attempt
with the greatest care to avoid any personal
offence, but I shall not hesitate to use the
knife with an unsparing hand, as is indeed
the duty of the Pastor whosoever he may
be. I remember a late dear friend of mine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
[who would not wish me to make his name
public but whom you will perhaps recognise
in the founder and builder of the new
Cathedral at Isaacsville in Canada<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>]. I remember
his saying to me with a merry
twinkle of the eye that looms only from the
free manhood of the west: “Lambkin,”
said he, “would you know how I made my
large fortune in the space of but three
months, and how I have attained to such
dignity and honour? It was by following
this simple maxim which my dear mother<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
taught me in the rough log-cabin<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> of my
birth: ‘Be courteous to all strangers, but
familiar with none.’”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>My friends, you are not strangers, nay, on
the present solemn occasion I think I may
call you friends&mdash;even brethren!&mdash;dear
brothers and sisters! But a little bird has
told me.... (<i>Here a genial smile passed
over his face and he drank a draught of pure
cold water from a tumbler at his side.</i>) A little
bird has told me, I say, that some of you
feared a trifle of just harshness, a reprimand
perhaps, or a warning note of danger,
at the best a doubtful and academic
temper as to the future. Fear nothing. I
shall pursue a far different course, and however
courteous I may be I shall indulge in
no familiarities.</p>

<p>“The Tertiary symptoms of Secondary
Education among the Poor” is a noble
phrase and expresses a noble idea. Why
the very words are drawn from our Anglo-Saxon
mother-tongue deftly mingled with
a few expressions borrowed from the old
dead language of long-past Greece and Rome.</p>

<p>What is Education? The derivation of
the word answers this question. It is from
“e” that is “out of,” “duc-o” “I lead,”
from the root Duc&mdash;to lead, to govern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
(whence we get so many of our most important
words such as “Duke”; “Duck” =
a drake; etc.) and finally the termination
“-tio” which corresponds to the English
“-ishness.” We may then put the whole
phrase in simple language thus, “The
threefold Showings of twofold Led-out-of-ishness
among the Needy.”</p>

<p>The Needy! The Poor! Terrible words!
It has been truly said that we have them
always with us. It is one of our peculiar
glories in nineteenth century England, that
we of the upper classes have fully recognised
our heavy responsibility towards our
weaker fellow-citizens. Not by Revolution,
which is dangerous and vain, not by heroic
legislation or hair-brained schemes of universal
panaceas, not by frothy Utopias. No!&mdash;by
solid hard work, by quiet and persistent
effort, with the slow invisible tenacity
that won the day at Badajoz, we have
won this great social victory. And if any
one should ask me for the result I should
answer him&mdash;go to Bolton, go to Manchester,
go to Liverpool; go to Hull or Halifax&mdash;the
answer is there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>There are many ways in which this good
work is proceeding. Life is a gem of many
facets. Some of my friends take refuge in
Prayer, others have joined the Charity
Organisation Society, others again have
laboured in a less brilliant but fully as
useful a fashion by writing books upon
social statistics which command an enormous
circulation. You have turned to education,
and you have done well. Show me
a miner or a stevedore who attends his
lectures upon Rossetti, and I will show you
a man. Show me his wife or daughter at
a cookery school or engaged in fretwork,
and I will shew you a woman. A man and
a woman&mdash;solemn thought!</p>

<p>A noble subject indeed and one to occupy
the whole life of a man! This “Education,”
this “Leading-out-of,” is the matter
of all our lives here in Oxford except in the
vacation.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And what an effect it has! Let
me prove it in a short example.</p>

<p>At a poor lodging-house in Lafayette,
Pa., U.S.A., three well-educated men from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
New England who had fallen upon evil
times were seated at a table surrounded by
a couple of ignorant and superstitious
Irishmen; these poor untaught creatures,
presuming upon their numbers, did not
hesitate to call the silent and gentlemanly
unfortunates “Dommed High-faluthing
Fules”; but mark the sequel. A fire broke
out in the night. The house was full of
these Irishmen and of yet more repulsive
Italians. Some were consumed by the devouring
element, others perished in the
flames, others again saved their lives by a
cowardly flight.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But what of those three
from Massachusetts whom better principles
had guided in youth and with whom philosophy
had replaced the bitter craft of the
Priest? They were found&mdash;my dear friends&mdash;they
were found still seated calmly at the
table; they had not moved; no passion had
blinded them, no panic disturbed: in their
charred and blackened features no trace of
terror was apparent. Such is the effect,
such the glory of what my late master and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
guide, the Professor of Tautology, used to
call the “Principle of the Survival of the
Fittest.”</p>

<p>(<i>Applause, which was only checked by a consideration
for the respect due to the Sacred
edifice.</i>)</p>

<p>Go forth then! Again I say go forth!
Go forth! Go forth! The time is coming
when England will see that your claims to
reverence, recognition and emolument are as
great as our own. I repeat it, go forth, and
when you have brought the great bulk of
families to change their mental standpoint,
then indeed you will have transformed the
world! For without the mind the human
intellect is nothing.</p>

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Leader</p>


<p>Mr. Solomon was ever determined to
keep the <i>Sunday Englishman</i> at a high level.
“We owe it” (he would say) “first to the
public who are thereby sacrificed&mdash;I mean
satisfied&mdash;and to ourselves, who secure
thereby a large and increasing circulation.”
[“Ourselves” alluded to the shareholders,
for the <i>Sunday Englishman</i> was a limited
Company, in which the shares (of which
Mr. Solomon held the greater number) were
distributed in the family; the tiniest toddler
of two years old was remembered, and had
been presented with a share by his laughing
and generous parent.]</p>

<p>In this laudable effort to keep “abreast
of the times” (as he phrased it), the Editor
and part Proprietor determined to have
leaders written by University men, who
from their position of vantage enjoy a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
unique experience in practical matters. He
had formed a very high opinion of Lambkin’s
journalistic capacity from his unpublished
letters as a special correspondent.
Indeed, he was often heard to say that “a
man like him was lost at Oxford, and was
born for Fleet Street.” He wrote, therefore,
to Mr. Lambkin and gave him “Carte
Blanche,” as one French scholar to another,
sending him only the general directions that
his leader must be “smart, up-to-date, and
with plenty of push,” it was to be “neither
too long nor too short,” and while it should
be written in an easy familiar tone, there
should be little or no seriously offensive
matter included.</p>

<p>Mr. Lambkin was delighted, and when
at his request the article had been paid for,
he sent in the following:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Leader.</span></p>

<p>“The English-Speaking Race has&mdash;if we
except the Dutch, Negro, and Irish elements&mdash;a
marvellous talent for self-government.
From the earliest origins of our Anglo-Saxon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
forefathers to the latest Parish Council,
guided but not controlled by the modern
‘Mass Thegen’ or local ‘Gesithcund man,’
this talent, or rather genius, is apparent.
We cannot tell why, in the inscrutable designs
of Providence, our chosen race should
have been so specially gifted, but certain it
is that wherever plain ordinary men <i>such as
I who write this and you who read it</i>,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> may be

read of him in books, the type of man who
forms the strength of this mighty national
organism? And who has not felt that he is
himself something of that kidney? We
stand aghast at our own extraordinary
power, and it has been finely said that
Nelson was greater than he knew. From
one end of the earth to the other the British
language is spoken and understood. The
very words that I am writing will be read
to-morrow in London, the day after in Oxford&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
from this it is but a step to the
uttermost parts of the earth.</p>

<p>“Under these conditions of power,
splendour, and domination it is intolerable
that the vast metropolis of this gigantic
empire should be pestered with crawling
cabs. There are indeed many things which
in the Divine plan have it in their nature to
crawl. We of all the races of men are the
readiest to admit the reign of universal law.
Meaner races know not the law, but we are
the children of the law, and where crawling
is part of the Cosmos we submit and quit
ourselves like men, being armed with the
armour of righteousness. Thus no Englishman
(whatever foreigners may feel) is
offended at a crawling insect or worm. A
wounded hare will crawl, and we Read that
‘the serpent was cursed and crawled upon
his belly’; again, Aristotle in his Ethics
talks of those whose nature (φύσις) it is
‘ἕρπειν,’ which is usually translated ‘to
crawl,’ and Kipling speaks of fifes ‘crawling.’
With all this we have no quarrel,
but the crawling cab is a shocking and
abominable thing; and if the titled owners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
of hansoms do not heed the warning in time
they will find that the spirit of Cromwell
is not yet dead, and mayhap the quiet
determined people of this realm will rise
and sweep them and their gaudy gew-gaws
and their finnicky high-stepping horses,
and their perched-up minions, from the fair
face of England.”</p>

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Remarks on the End of Term</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Delivered in Hall on Saturday, Dec. 6th,
1887, the morning upon which the College
went down.</i></p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friends; my dear Undergraduate
members of this College</span>,</p>
</div>

<p>The end of Term is approaching&mdash;nay,
is here. A little more, and we shall
meet each other no longer for six weeks.
It is a solemn and a sacred thought. It is
not the sadness, and even the regret, that
takes us at the beginning of the Long
Vacation. This is no definitive close. We
lose (I hope) no friends; none leave us for
ever, unless I may allude to the young man
whom few of you knew, but through whose
criminal folly the head of this foundation
has lost the use of one eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>This is not a time of exaltation, so should
it not be a time for too absolute a mourning.
This is not the end of the Easter
Term, nor of the Summer Term. It is the
end of Michaelmas Term. That is the fact,
and facts must be looked in the face.
What are we to do with the approaching
vacation? What have we done with the
past term?</p>

<p>In the past term (I think I can answer
for some of you) a much deeper meaning
has entered into your lives. Especially you,
the young freshmen (happily I have had
the control of many, the teaching of some),
I know that life has become fuller for you.
That half-hour a week to which you pay so
little heed will mean much in later years.
You have come to me in batches for half-an-hour
a week, and each of you has thus
enjoyed collectively the beginning of that
private control and moulding of the character
which is the object of all our efforts here
in Oxford. And can you not, as you look
back, see what a great change has passed
over you in the short few months? I do
not mean the corporeal change involved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
by our climate or our prandial habits;
neither do I allude to the change in your
dress and outward appearance. I refer to
the mental transformation.</p>

<p>You arrived sure of a number of things
which you had learnt at school or at your
mother’s knee. Of what are you certain now?
Of nothing! It is necessary in the mysterious
scheme of education that this blind faith or
certitude should be laid as a foundation in
early youth. But it is imperative that a
man&mdash;if he is to be a man and not a monster&mdash;should
lose it at the outset of his
career. My young friends, I have given
you the pearl of great price. You have
begun to doubt.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour a week&mdash;four hours in all
the term ... could any positive, empirical,
or dogmatic teaching have been conveyed
in that time, or with so much fullness
as the great scheme of negation can
be? I trow not.</p>

<p>So much for knowledge and tutorship.
What of morals? It is a delicate subject,
but I will treat of it boldly. You all remember
how, shortly after the month of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
October, the College celebrated Guy
Fawkes’ day: the elders, by a dinner in
honour of their founder, the juniors by
lighting a bonfire in the quadrangle. You
all know what followed. I do not wish to
refer again&mdash;certainly not with bitterness&mdash;to
the excesses of that evening; but the loss
of eyesight is a serious thing, and one that
the victim may forgive, but hardly can forget.
I hope the lesson will suffice, and
that in future no fellow of this College will
have to regret so serious a disfigurement at
the hands of a student.</p>

<p>To pass to lighter things. The Smoking
Concert on All Souls’ Day was a great
success. I had hoped to organise some
similar jollity on Good Friday, but I find
that it falls in the Easter vacation. It is,
however, an excellent precedent, and we
will not fail to have one on some other festal
occasion. To the action of one of our least
responsible members I will not refer. But
surely there is neither good breeding nor
decency in dressing up as an old lady, in
assuming the name of one of our Greatest
Families, and in so taking advantage of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
chivalry, and perhaps the devotion, of one’s
superiors. The offence is one that can not
lightly be passed over, and the culprit will
surely be discovered.</p>

<p>Of the success of the College at hockey
and in the inter-University draughts competition,
I am as proud as yourselves.
[<i>Loud cheers, lasting for several minutes.</i>]
They were games of which in my youth I was
myself proud. On the river I see no reason
to be ashamed; next term we have the
Torpids, and after that the Eights. We
have no cause to despair. It is my experience
(an experience based on ten years
of close observation), that no college can
permanently remain at the bottom of the
river. There is a tide in the affairs of men,
which taken at the flood leads on to fortune,
let us therefore taking heart of grace and
screw our courage to the sticking point.
We have the lightest cox. in the ’Varsity
and an excellent coach. Much may be done
with these things.</p>

<p>As to the religious state of the college it
is, as you all know, excellent&mdash;I wish I
could say the same for the Inorganic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Chemistry. This province falls under the
guidance of Mr. Large, but the deficiency
in our standing is entirely the fault of his
pupils. There are not twenty men in the
University better fitted to teach Inorganic
Chemistry than my colleague. At any rate
it is a very grave matter and one by which
a college ultimately stands or falls.</p>

<p>We have had no deaths to deplore during
this term, and in my opinion the attack of
mumps that affected the college during
November can hardly be called an epidemic.
The drains will be thoroughly overhauled
during the vacation, and the expense of
this, spread as it will be among all undergraduate
members whether in residence or
not, will form a very trifling addition to
Battells. I doubt if its effect will be felt.</p>

<p>There is one last thing that I shall touch
upon. We have been constantly annoyed
by the way in which undergraduates tread
down the lawn. The Oxford turf is one of
the best signs of our antiquity as a university.
There is no turf like it in the world.
The habit of continually walking upon it is
fatal to its appearance. Such an action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
would certainly never be permitted in a
gentleman’s seat, and there is some talk of
building a wall round the quadrangle to
prevent the practice in question. I need
hardly tell you what a disfigurement such a
step would involve, but if there is one
thing in the management of the college
that I am more determined upon than
another it is that no one be he scholar or be
he commoner shall walk upon the grass!</p>

<p>I wish you a very Merry Christmas at the
various country houses you may be visiting,
and hope and pray that you may find united
there all the members of your own family.</p>

<p>Mr. Gurge will remain behind and speak
to me for a few moments.</p>

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Article on the North-west
Corner of the Mosaic Pavement of the
Roman Villa at Bignor</p>


<p>Of Mr. Lambkin’s historical research
little mention has been made, because this
was but the recreation of a mind whose
serious work was much more justly calculated
to impress posterity. It is none the
less true that he had in the inner <i>coterie</i> of
Antiquarians, a very pronounced reputation,
and that on more than one occasion his
discoveries had led to animated dispute
and even to friction. He is referred to as
“Herr Professor Lambkin” in Winsk’s
“Roman Sandals,”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and Mr. Bigchurch in
the Preface of his exhaustive work on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
“The Drainage of the Grecian Sea Port”
(which includes much information on the
Ionian colonies and Magna Graecia) acknowledges
Mr. Lambkin’s “valuable sympathy
and continuous friendly aid which
have helped him through many a dark
hour.” Lambkin was also frequently sent
books on Greek and Roman Antiquities
to review; and it must be presumed that
the editor of <i>Culture</i>,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> who was himself
an Oxford man and had taken a House
degree in 1862, would hardly have had such
work done by an ignorant man.</p>

<p>If further proof were needed of Mr.
Lambkin’s deep and minute scholarship in
this matter it would be discovered in the
many reproductions of antiquities which
used to hang round his room in college.
They were photographs of a reddish-brown
colour and represented many objects dear to
the Scholar, such as the Parthenon, the
Temples of Paestum, the Apollo Belvedere,
and the Bronze head at the Vatican; called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
in its original dedication an Ariadne, but
more properly described by M. Crémieux-Nathanson,
in the light of modern research,
as a Silenus.</p>

<p>Any doubts as to Lambkin’s full claim to
detailed-knowledge in those matters, will,
however, be set at rest by the one thing he
has left us of the kind&mdash;his article in the
<i>Revue Intellectuelle</i>, which was translated for
him by a Belgian friend, but of which I
have preserved the original MSS.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> It is as
follows:</p>


<p class="center">THE ARTICLE.</p>

<p>I cannot conceive how M. Bischoff<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and
Herr Crapiloni<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> can have fallen into their
grotesque error with regard to the Head in
the Mosaic at Bignor. The Head, as all the
world knows, is to be found in the extreme
north-west corner of the floor of the Mosaic
at Bignor, in Sussex. Its exact dimensions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
from the highest point of the crown to the
point or cusp of the chin, and from the
furthest back edge of the cerebellum to the
outer tip of the nose are one foot five inches
and one foot three inches, respectively. The
Head is thus of the Heroic or exaggerated
size, and <i>not</i> (as Wainwright says in his
<i>Antiquities</i>), “of life size.” It represents the
head and face of an old man, and is composed
of fragments, in which are used the
colours black, brown, blue, yellow, pink,
green, purple and bright orange. There
can be no doubt that the floor must have
presented a very beautiful and even brilliant
appearance when it was new, but at the
present day it is much dulled from having
lain buried for fifteen hundred years.</p>

<p>My contention is that M. Bischoff and
Herr Crapiloni have made a very ridiculous
mistake (I will not call it by a harsher name)
in representing this head to be a figure of
Winter. In one case (that of M. Bischoff)
I have no doubt that patriotic notions were
too strong for a well-balanced judgment;<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
but in the other, I am at a loss to find a
sufficient basis for a statement which is not
only false, but calculated to do a grave hurt
to history and even to public morals. M.
Bischoff admits that he visited England in
company with Herr Crapiloni&mdash;I have no
doubt that the latter influenced the former,
and that the blame and shame of this matter
must fall on the ultra-montane German and
not on the philosophical but enthusiastic
Gaul.</p>

<p>For my opponents’ abuse of myself in the
columns of such rags as the <i>Bulletin de la
Société Historique de Bourges</i>, or the <i>Revue
d’Histoire Romaine</i>, I have only contempt
and pity; but <i>we</i> in <i>England</i> are taught that
a lie on any matter is equally serious, and I
will be no party to the calling of the Mosaic
a figure of “Winter” when I am convinced it
is nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>As far as I can make out from their somewhat
turgid rhetoric, my opponents rely
upon the inscription “Hiems” put in with
white stones beneath the mosaic, and they
argue that, as the other four corners are admitted
to be “Spring,” “Summer,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
“Autumn,” each with their title beneath,
<i>therefore</i> this fourth corner must be Winter!</p>

<p>It is just such an argument from analogy
as I should have expected from men brought
up in the corrupt morality and the base religious
conceptions of the Continent! When
one is taught that authority is everything
and cannot use one’s judgment,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> one is almost
certain to jump at conclusions in this
haphazard fashion in dealing with definite
facts.</p>

<p>For my part I am convinced that the
head is the portrait of the Roman proprietor
of the villa, and I am equally convinced
that the title “Hiems” has been added
below at a later date, so as to furnish a trap
for all self-sufficient and gullible historians.
Are my continental critics aware that <i>no
single copy</i> of the mosaic is to be found in
the whole of the Roman Remains of
Britain? Are they aware the villa at Bignor
has changed hands three times in
this century? I do not wish to make any
insinuations of bad faith, but I would hint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
that the word “Hiems” has a fresh new
look about it which puzzles me.</p>

<p>To turn to another matter, though it is
one connected with our subject. The
pupil of the eye has disappeared. We know
that the loss is of ancient date, as Wright
mentions its absence in his catalogue. A
very interesting discussion has arisen as to
the material of which the pupil was composed.
The matter occupied the Society at
Dresden (of which I am a corresponding
member) in a debate of some days, I have
therefore tried to fathom it but with only
partial success. I have indeed found a
triangular blue fragment which is much the
same shape as the missing cavity; it is
however, somewhat larger in all its
dimensions, and is convex instead of flat,
and I am assured it is but a piece of blue
china of recent manufacture, of which many
such odds and ends are to be found in the
fields and dustbins. If (as I strongly
suspect) these suggestions are only a ruse,
and if (as I hope will be the case) my fragment,
after some filing and chipping, can
be made to fit the cavity, the discovery will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
be of immense value; for it will show that
the owner of the villa was a Teuton and will
go far to prove the theory of Roman continuity,
which is at present based on such
slight evidence. I will let you know the
result.</p>

<p>The coins recently dug up in the neighbourhood,
and on which so many hopes were
based, prove nothing as to the date of the
mosaic. They cannot be of Roman origin,
for they bear for the most part the head
and inscription of William III., while the
rest are pence and shillings of the Georges.
One coin was a guinea, and will, I fear, be
sold as gold to the bank. I was very disappointed
to find so poor a result: ever
since my enquiry labourers have kept coming
to me with coins obviously modern&mdash;especially
bronze coins of Napoleon III.&mdash;which
they have buried to turn them
green, and subsequently hammered shapeless
in the hopes of my purchasing them.
I have had the misfortune to purchase, for
no less a sum than a sovereign, what turned
out to be the circular brass label on a dog’s
collar. It contained the name of “Ponto,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
inscribed in a classic wreath which deceived
me.</p>

<p>Nothing else of real importance has
occurred since my last communication.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XIII">XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Sermon.</p>


<p>A man not over-given to mere words,
Lambkin was always also somewhat diffident
of his pulpit eloquence and his sermons
were therefore rare. It must not be
imagined that he was one of those who
rebel vainly against established usage.
There was nothing in him of the blatant
and destructive demagogue; no character
could have been more removed from the
demons who drenched the fair soil of
France with such torrents of blood during
the awful reign of terror.</p>

<p>But just as he was in politics a liberal in
the truest sense (not in the narrow party
definition of the word), so in the religious
sphere he descried the necessity of gentle
but persistent reform. “The present,” he
would often say, “is inseparable from the
past,” but he would add “continual modification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
to suit the necessities of a changing
environment is a cardinal condition of
vitality.”</p>

<p>It was, therefore, his aim to keep the form
of all existing institutions and merely to
change their matter.</p>

<p>Thus, he was in favour of the retention of
the Regius Professorship of Greek, and
even voted for a heavy increase in the salary
of its occupant; but he urged and finally
carried the amendment by which that
dignitary is at present compelled to lecture
mainly on current politics. Mathematics
again was a subject whose interest he
discerned, however much he doubted its
value as a mental discipline; he was, therefore,
a supporter of the prize fellowships
occasionally offered on the subject, but, in
the determination of the successful candidate
he would give due weight to the
minutiae of dress and good manners.</p>

<p>It will be seen from all this that if
Lambkin was essentially a modern, yet he
was as essentially a wise and moderate man;
cautious in action and preferring judgment
to violence he would often say, “<i>trans</i>former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
please, not <i>re</i>former,” when his
friends twitted him over the port with his
innovations.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Religion, then, which must be a matter
of grave import to all, was not neglected by
such a mind.</p>

<p>He saw that all was not lost when dogma
failed, but that the great ethical side of the
system could be developed in the room left
by the decay of its formal character. Just
as a man who has lost his fingers will
sometimes grow thumbs in their place, so
Lambkin foresaw that in the place of what
was an atrophied function, vigorous examples
of an older type might shoot up, and
the organism would gain in breadth what
it lost in definition. “I look forward to
the time” (he would cry) “when the devotional
hand of man shall be all thumbs.”</p>

<p>The philosophy which he thus applied to
formal teaching and dogma took practical
effect in the no less important matter of the
sermon. He retained that form or shell, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
he raised it as on stepping-stones from its
dead self to higher things; the success of
many a man in this life has been due to the
influence exerted by his simple words.</p>

<p>The particular allocution which I have
chosen as the best illustration of his method
was not preached in the College Chapel,
but was on the contrary a University
Sermon given during eight weeks. It ran
as follows:</p>


<p class="center">SERMON</p>

<p>I take for my text a beautiful but little-known
passage from the Talmud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>I will arise and gird up my lions&mdash;I mean
loins&mdash;and go; yea, I will get me out of the land
of my fathers which is in Ben-ramon, even unto
Edom and the Valley of Kush and the cities
about Laban to the uttermost ends of the earth.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>There is something about foreign travel,
my dear Brethren, which seems, as it were,
a positive physical necessity to our eager
and high-wrought generation. At specified
times of the year we hunt, or debate; we
attend to our affairs in the city, or we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
occupy our minds with the guidance of
State. The ball-room, the drawing-room,
the club, each have their proper season. In
our games football gives place to cricket,
and the deep bay of the faithful hound
yields with the advancing season to the
sharp crack of the Winchester, as the
grouse, the partridge, or the very kapper-capercailzie
itself falls before the superior
intelligence of man. One fashion also will
succeed another, and in the mysterious development
of the years&mdash;a development not
entirely under the guidance of our human
wills&mdash;the decent croquet-ball returns to
lawns that had for so long been strangers to
aught but the fierce agility of tennis.</p>

<p>So in the great procession of the times
and the seasons, there comes upon us the
time for travel. It is not (my dear Brethren),
it is not in the winter when all is covered
with a white veil of snow&mdash;or possibly
transformed with the marvellous effects of
thaw; it is not in the spring when the buds
begin to appear in the hedges, and when
the crocus studs the spacious sward in
artful disorder and calculated negligence&mdash;no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
it is not then&mdash;the old time of Pilgrimage,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
that our positive and enlightened era
chooses for its migration.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>It is in the burning summer season, when
the glare of the sun is almost painful to the
jaded eye of the dancer, when the night is
shortest and the day longest, that we fly
from these inhospitable shores and green
fields of England.</p>

<p>And whither do we fly? Is it to the cool
and delicious north, to the glaciers of
Greenland, or to the noble cliffs and
sterling characters of Orkney? Is it to
Norway? Can it be to Lapland? Some
perhaps, a very few, are to be found
journeying to these places in the commodious
and well-appointed green boats of Mr.
Wilson, of Tranby Croft. But, alas! the
greater number leave the hot summer of
England for the yet more torrid climes of
Italy, Spain, the Levant and the Barbary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
coast. Negligent of the health that is our
chiefest treasure, we waste our energies in
the malaria of Rome, or in Paris poison our
minds with the contempt aroused by the
sight of hideous foreigners.</p>

<p>Let me turn from this painful aspect of a
question which certainly presents nobler
and more useful issues. It is most to our
purpose, perhaps, in a certain fashion; it is
doubtless more to our purpose in many ways
to consider on an occasion such as this the
moral aspects of foreign travel, and chief
among these I reckon those little points of
mere every day practice, which are of so
much greater importance than the rare and
exaggerated acts to which our rude ancestors
gave the name of Sins.</p>

<p>Consider the over-charges in hotels. The
economist may explain, the utilitarian may
condone such action, but if we are to make
for Righteousness, we cannot pass without
censure a practice which we would hardly
go so far as to condemn. If there be in the
sacred edifice any one of those who keep
houses of entertainment upon the Continent,
especially if there sit among you any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
representative of that class in Switzerland,
I would beg him to consider deeply a matter
which the fanatical clergy of his land may
pardon, but which it is the duty of ours to
publicly deplore.</p>

<p>Consider again the many examples of
social and moral degradation which we
meet with in our journeyings! We pass
from the coarse German, to the inconstant
Gaul. We fly the indifference and ribald
scoffing of Milan only to fall into the sink
of idolatory and superstition which men
call Naples; we observe in our rapid flight
the indolent Spaniard, the disgusting Slav,
the uncouth Frisian and the frightful Hun.
Our travels will not be without profit if
they teach us to thank Heaven that our
fathers preserved us from such a lot as
theirs.</p>

<p>Again, we may consider the great advantages
that we may gather as individuals
from travel. We can exercise our financial
ingenuity (and this is no light part of
mental training) in arranging our expenses
for the day. We can find in the corners of
foreign cities those relics of the Past which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the callous and degraded people of the
place ignore, and which are reserved for
the appreciation of a more vigorous race.
In the galleries we learn the beauties of a
San Mirtānoja, and the vulgar insufficiency
and ostentation of a Sanzio.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In a thousand
ways the experience of the Continent
is a consolation and a support.</p>

<p>Fourthly, my dear brethren, we contrast
our sturdy and honest crowd of tourists with
the ridiculous castes and social pettiness of
the ruck of foreign nations. There the peasant,
the bourgeois, the noble, the priest, the
politician, the soldier, seems each to live in his
own world. In our happier England there
are but two classes, the owners of machinery
and the owners of land; and these are so
subtly and happily mixed, there is present
at the same time so hearty an independence
and so sensible a recognition of rank, that
the whole vast mass of squires and merchants
mingle in an exquisite harmony, and pour
like a life-giving flood over the decaying
cities of Europe.</p>

<p>But I have said enough. I must draw to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
a close. The love of fame, which has been
beautifully called the last infirmity of noble-minds,
alone would tempt me to proceed.
But I must end. I hope that those of you
who go to Spain will visit the unique and
interesting old town of Saragossa.</p>

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Open Letter to Churchmen</p>


<p>The noise made by Mr. Lambkin’s
famous advice to Archdeacon Burfle will
be remembered by all my readers. He did
not, however, publish the letter (as is erroneously
presumed in <i>Great Dead Men of the
Period</i>),<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> without due discussion and reflection.
I did not personally urge him to
make it public&mdash;I thought it unwise. But
Mr. Large may almost be said to have
insisted upon it in the long Conversation
which he and Josiah had upon the matter.
When Lambkin had left Large’s room I took
the liberty of going up to see him again, but
the fatal missive had been posted, and
appeared next day in <i>The Times</i>, the <i>Echo</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
and other journals, not to mention the
<i>Englishman’s Anchor</i>. I do not wish to
accuse Mr. Large of any malicious purpose
or deliberately misleading intention, but I
fear that (as he was not an impulsive man)
his advice can only have proceeded from a
woeful and calculated lack of judgment.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that (from Lambkin’s
own point of view), the publication of this
letter was a very serious error. It bitterly
offended Arthur Bundleton, and alienated
all the “Pimlico” group (as they were then
called). At the same time it did not satisfy
the small but eager and cultured body who
followed Tamworthy. It gave a moderate
pleasure to the poorer clergy in the country
parishes, but I doubt very much whether
these are the men from whom social advantage
or ecclesiastical preferment is to be
expected. I often told Lambkin that the
complexity of our English Polity was a
dangerous thing to meddle with. “A
man,” I would say to him, “who expresses
an opinion is like one who plunges a knife
into some sensitive part of the human
frame. The former may offend unwittingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
by the mere impact of his creed or prejudice,
much as the latter may give pain by happening
upon some hidden nerve.”</p>

<p>Now Lambkin was essentially a wise
man. He felt the obligation&mdash;the duty (to
give it a nobler name)&mdash;which is imposed
on all of us of studying our fellows. He
did not, perhaps, say where his mind lay in
any matter more than half a dozen times in
his life, for fear of opposing by such an
expression the wider experience or keener
emotion of the society around him. He
felt himself a part of a great stream, which
it was the business of a just man to follow,
and if he spoke strongly (as he often did) it
was in some matter upon which the vast
bulk of his countrymen were agreed;
indeed he rightly gave to public opinion,
and to the governing classes of the nation,
an overwhelming weight in his system of
morals; and even at twenty-one he had a
wholesome contempt for the doctrinaire
enthusiast who neglects his newspaper and
hatches an ethical system out of mere
blind tradition or (what is worse) his inner
conscience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>It is remarkable, therefore, that such a
man should have been guilty of one
such error. “It was not a crime,” he
said cleverly, in speaking of the matter
to me, “it was worse; it was a
blunder.” And that is what we all felt.
The matter can be explained, however,
by a reference to the peculiar conditions
of the moment in which it appeared. The
Deanery of Bury had just fallen vacant by
death of Henry Carver, the elder.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> A
Liberal Unionist Government was in power,
and Lambkin perhaps imagined that controversy
still led&mdash;as it had done but a few
years before&mdash;to the public notice which it
merits. He erred, but it was a noble error.</p>

<p>One thing at least we can rejoice in, the
letter may have hurt Lambkin in this poor
mortal life; but it was of incalculable advantage
to the generation immediately succeeding
his own. I cannot but believe that from
that little source springs all the mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
river of reform which has left so profound
a mark upon the hosiery of this our day.</p>

<p>The letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">AN OPEN LETTER</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Burford.</span> <i>St. John’s Eve, 1876.</i>
</p>
<p class="i1">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Burfle</span>,
</p>

<p><span class="i2">You have asked my advice on a
matter of deep import, a matter upon which
every self-respecting Englishman is asking
himself the question “Am I a <i>sheep</i> or a
<i>goat</i>?” My dear Burfle, I will answer you
straight out, and I know you will not be
angry with me if I answer also in the
agora, “before the people,” as Paul would
have done. Are you a <i>sheep</i> or a <i>goat</i>?
Let us think.</span></p>

<p>You say rightly that the question upon
which all this turns is the question of
boots. It is but a symbol, but it is a
symbol upon which all England is divided.
On the one hand we have men strenuous,
determined, eager&mdash;men (if I may say so) of
true Apostolic quality, to whom the
buttoned boot is sacred to a degree some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
us may find it difficult to understand. They
are few, are these devout pioneers, but they
are in certain ways, and from some points
of view, among the <i>élite</i> of the Nation, so to
speak.</p>

<p>On the other hand we have the great
mass of sensible men, earnest, devout,
practical&mdash;what Beeker calls in a fine
phrase “Thys corpse and verie bodie of
England<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>”&mdash;determined to maintain what
their fathers had before them, and insisting
on the laced boot as the proper foot-gear of
the Church.</p>

<p>No one is more sensible than myself (my
dear Burfle), I say no one is more sensible
than I am, of the gravity of this schism&mdash;for
schism it threatens to be. And no one
appreciates more than I do how much there
is to be said on both sides. The one party
will urge (with perfect justice), that the
buttoned boot is a development. They maintain
(and there is much to be said in their
favour), that the common practice of wearing
buttoned boots, their ornate appearance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
and the indication of well-being which they
afford, fit them most especially for the
Service of the Temple. They are seen upon
the feet of Parisians, of Romans, of Viennese;
they are associated with our modern
occasions of Full Dress, and when we wear
them we feel that we are one with all that
is of ours in Christendom. In a word, they
are Catholic, in the best and truest sense of
the word.</p>

<p>Now, my dear Burfle, consider the other
side of the argument. The laced boot,
modern though it be in form and black and
solid, is yet most undoubtedly the Primitive
Boot in its essential. That the early Christians
wore sandals is now beyond the reach
of doubt or the power of the wicked.
There is indeed the famous forgery of
Gelasius, which may have imposed upon
the superstition of the dark ages,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> there is
the doubtful evidence also of the mosaic at
Ravenna. But the only solid ground ever
brought forward was the passage in the
Pseudo-Johannes, which no modern scholar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
will admit to refer to buttons. ξύγον means
among other things a lace, an absolute lace,
and I defy our enemies (who are many and
unscrupulous), to deny. The Sandal has
been finally given its place as a Primitive
Christian ornament; and we can crush the
machinations of foreign missions, I think,
with the plain sentence of that great
scholar, Dr. Junker, “The sandal,” he
says, “is the parent of the laced boot.”</p>

<p>So far then, so good. You see (my dear
Burfle), how honestly the two sides may
differ, and how, with such a backing upon
either side, the battle might rage indefinitely,
to the final extinction, perhaps, of our
beloved country and its most cherished
institutions.</p>

<p>Is there no way by which such a catastrophe
may be avoided?</p>

<p>Why most certainly <i>yes</i>. There is a road
on which both may travel, a place in which
all may meet. I mean the boot (preferably
the cloth boot) with elastic sides. Already
it is worn by many of our clergy.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
offends neither party, it satisfies, or should
satisfy, both; and for my part, I see in it
one of those compromises upon which our
greatness is founded. Let us then determine
to be in this matter neither <i>sheep</i> nor
<i>goats</i>. It is better, far better, to admit
some sheepishness into our goatishness, or
(if our extremists <i>will</i> have it so), some
goatishness into our sheepishness&mdash;it is
better, I say, to enter one fold and be at
peace together, than to imperil our most
cherished and beloved tenets in a mere
wrangle upon non-essentials. For, after all
what is essential to us? Not boots, I think,
but righteousness. Righteousness may express
itself in boots, it is just and good
that it should do so, but to see righteousness
in the boot itself is to fall into the
gross materialism of the middle ages, and
to forget our birthright and the mess of
pottage.</p>

<p class="cd">Lambkin’s Letter to a French Friend</p>


<p>Lambkin’s concern for the Continent
was deep and lasting. He knew the
Western part of this Division of the Globe
from a constant habit of travel which would
take him by the Calais-Bâle, passing through
the St. Gothard by night, and so into the
storied plains of Italy.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> It was at Milan
that he wrote his <i>Shorter Anglo-Saxon
Grammar</i>, and in Assisi that he corrected
the proofs of his article on the value of
oats as human food. Everyone will remember
the abominable outrage at Naples,
where he was stabbed by a coachman in revenge
for his noble and disinterested protection
of a poor cab-horse; in a word,
Italy is full of his vacations, and no name
is more familiar to the members of the
Club at the Villa Marinoni.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>It may seem strange that under such
circumstances our unhappy neighbours
across the Channel should so especially
have taken up his public action. He was
no deep student of the French tongue, and
he had but a trifling acquaintance with the
habits of the common people of that country;
but he has said himself with great
fervour, in his “Thoughts on Political
Obligations,” that no man could be a good
citizen of England who did not understand
her international position. “What” (he
would frequently exclaim) “what can they
know of England, who only England
know?”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> He did not pretend to a familiarity
with the minute details of foreign
policy, nor was he such a pedant as to be
offended at the good-humoured chaff directed
against his accent in the pronunciation
of foreign names. Nevertheless he
thought it&mdash;and rightly thought it&mdash;part of
his duty to bring into any discussion of the
affairs of the Republic those chance phrases
which lend colour and body to a conversation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
He found this duty as it lay in his
path and accomplished it, without bombast,
but with full determination, and with a
vast firmness of purpose. Thus he would
often let drop such expressions as “état
majeur,” “la cléricalisme c’est l’ennemi,”
“l’état c’est moi,”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and such was his painful
and exact research that he first in the University
arrived at the meaning of the word
“bordereau,” which, until his discovery, all
had imagined to be a secret material of
peculiar complexity.</p>

<p>Mr. Lambkin had but one close friend in
France, a man who had from cosmopolitan
experience acquired a breadth and humour
which the Frenchman so conspicuously
lacks; he united, therefore, the charm of
the French character to that general experience
which Lambkin invariably demanded
of his friends, and the fact that he belonged
to a small political minority and had so
long associated with foreigners had winnowed
from that fine soul the grossness
and one-sidedness, the mingled vanity and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
ferocity, which seems so fatal a part of the
Gallic temper. In some ways this friend
reminded one of the great Huguenots
whom France to her eternal loss banished
by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and
of whom a bare twenty thousand are now
to be found in the town of Nîmes. In
other ways this gifted mind recalled&mdash;and
this would be in his moments of just indignation&mdash;the
manner and appearance of a
Major Prophet.</p>

<p>Jules de la Vaguère dè Bissac was the
first of his family to bear that ancient
name, but not the least worthy. Born on a
Transatlantic in the port of Hamburg, his
first experience of life had been given him
in the busy competition of New York. It
was there that he acquired the rapid
glance, the grasp, the hard business head
which carried him from Buenos Ayres to
Amsterdam, and finally to a fortune. His
wealth he spent in the entertainment of his
numerous friends, in the furtherance of just
aims in politics (to which alas! the rich in
France do not subscribe as they should), to
the publication of sound views in the press,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
and occasionally (for old habit is second
nature<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>), in the promotion of some industrial
concern destined to benefit his country
and the world.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> With transactions, however
sound and honest, that savoured of
mere speculation De Bissac would have
nothing to do, and when his uncle and
brother fled the country in 1887, he helped,
indeed, with his purse but he was never
heard to excuse or even to mention the
poor, fallen men.</p>

<p>His hotel in the Rue des Fortifications
(a modest but coquettish little gem, whose
doors were bronze copies of the famous
gates of the Baptistery at Florence), had
often received Mr. Lambkin and a happy
circle of friends. Judge then of the horror
and indignation with which Oxford heard
that two of its beautiful windows had been
intentionally broken on the night of June
15th, 1896. The famous figure of “Mercy,”
taken from the stained glass at Rheims,
was destroyed and one of the stones had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
fallen on the floor within an inch of a
priceless Sèvres vase that had once belonged
to Law and had been bought
from M. Panama. It was on the occasion
of this abominable outrage that Mr. Lambkin
sent the following letter, which, as it
was published in the <i>Horreur</i>, I make no
scruple of reprinting. But, for the sake of
the historical interest it possesses, I give it
in its original form:&mdash;</p>

<p class="i1">
“<span class="smcap">Cher Ami et Monsieur</span>,

<p><span class="i2">Je n’ai pas de doute que vous aurez

bienveillance par vous et votre aimable
famille.</span></p>

<p>Vous aurez donc immediatement après
l’accident pensé à nous car vous aurez su
que nous étions, moi et Bilkin, vos amis
sincerès surtout dans la politique. Nous
avons expecté quelque chose pareille et
nous comprenons bien pourquoi c’est le
mauvais Durand qui a jété les pierres.

Souvenez-vous en future que c’est exactement
ceux à qui nous pretons de l’argent
et devraient être dévoués à nous, qui deviennent
des ennemis. Voilà ce qui empêche
si souvent de faire du bien excepté à
ceux qui nous seront fideles et doux.</p>

<p>(<i>All this, being of a private nature, was not
printed in M. de Bissac’s paper. The public
portion follows.</i>)</p>

<p>Il est bien evident d’où viennent des
abominables et choquants choses pareilles.
C’est que la France se meurent. Un pays
où il n’y a personne<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> qui peut empecher des
fanatiques de briser les verres est un pays
en décadence, voilà ce que l’Irlande aurait
été si nous étions pas là pour l’empecher.
On briserait des verres très surement et
beaucoup. J’espère que je ne blesse pas
votre cœur de Français en disant tout celà,
mais il est bien mieux de connaître ce que
l’on a, même si c’est mortel comme en
France.</p>

<p>Vous l’avez bien dit c’est les militarisme
et cléricalisme qui font ces outrages. Examinez<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
bien l’homme qui a fait ça et vous

<p>J’ai lu avec grand plaisir votre article

<p class="cd">Interview with Mr. Lambkin.</p>


<p>A representative of <i>The J. C. R.</i> had,
but a short while before his death, the
privilege of an interview with Mr. Lambkin
on those numerous questions of the day
which the enterprise of the Press puts before
its readers. The meeting has a most pathetic
interest! Here was the old man full
and portly, much alive to current questions,
and to the last a true representative of his
class. Within a week the fatal Gaudy had
passed and he was no more! Though the
words here given are reported by another,
they bear the full, fresh impress of his
personality and I treasure them as the last
authentic expression of that great mind.</p>

<p>“Ringing the bell” (writes our representative)
“at a neat villa in the Banbury Road,
the door was answered by a trim serving-maid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
in a chintz gown and with a white
cap on her head. The whole aspect of Mr.
Lambkin’s household without and within
breathes repose and decent merriment. I
was ushered into a well-ordered study, and
noticed upon the walls a few handsome
prints, chosen in perfect taste and solidly
mounted in fine frames, ‘The meeting of
Wellington and Blucher at Waterloo,’ ‘John
Knox preaching before Mary Queen of
Scots,’ ‘The trial of Lord William Russell,’
and two charming pictures of a child and a
dog: ‘Can ’oo talk?’ and ‘Me too!’ completed
the little gallery. I noticed also a fine
photograph of the Marquis of Llanidloes,
whose legal attainments and philological
studies had formed a close bond between
him and Mr. Lambkin. A faded daguerreotype
of Mr. Lambkin’s mother and a
pencil sketch of his father’s country seat
possessed a pathetic interest.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lambkin came cheerily into the
room, and I plunged at once ‘in medias
res.’</p>

<p>“‘Pray Mr. Lambkin what do you think
of the present position of parties?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“‘Why, if you ask me,’ he replied, with an
intelligent look, ‘I think the great party
system needs an opposition to maintain it
in order, and I regret the absence of any
man of weight or talent&mdash;I had almost
said of common decency&mdash;on the Liberal
side. The late Lord Llanidloes&mdash;who was
the old type of Liberal&mdash;such a noble heart!&mdash;said
to me in this very room, ‘Mark my
words, Lambkin’ (said he) ‘<i>the Opposition
is doomed</i>.’ This was in Mr. Gladstone’s
1885 Parliament; it has always seemed to
me a wonderful prophecy. But Llanidloes
was a wonderful man, and the place of
second Under-Secretary for Agriculture was
all too little a reward for such services as his
to the State. ‘Do you know those lines,’
here Mr. Lambkin grew visibly affected,
‘Then all were for the party and none were
for the State, the rich man paid the poor
man, and the weak man loved the great’?
‘I fear those times will never come again.’</p>

<p>“A profound silence followed. ‘However,’
continued he with quiet emphasis,
‘Home Rule is dead, and there is no
immediate danger of any tampering with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the judicial system of Great Britain after
the fashion that obtains in France.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ he continued, with the smile that
makes him so familiar, ‘these are my books:
trifles,&mdash;but my own. Here’ (taking down
a volume), ‘is <i>What would Cromwell have
done?</i>&mdash;a proposal for reforming Oxford.
Then here, in a binding with purple flowers,
is my <i>Time and Purpose</i>,&mdash;a devotional book
which has sold largely. The rest of the
shelf is what I call my ‘casual’ work. It
was mainly done for that great modern
publisher,&mdash;Matthew Straight, who knows
so well how to combine the old Spirit with
Modern exigencies. You know his beautiful
sign of the Boiling Pot in Plummer’s Court?
It was painted for him by one of his young
artists. You have doubtless seen his name
in the lists of guests at country houses; I
often meet him when I go to visit my
friends, and we plan a book together.</p>

<p>“‘Thus my <i>Boys of Great Britain</i>&mdash;an
historical work, was conceived over the excellent
port of Baron Gusmann at Westburton
Abbey. Then there is the expansion
of this book, <i>English Boyhood</i>, in three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
volumes, of which only two have appeared&mdash;<i>Anglo-Saxon
Boyhood</i> and <i>Mediæval Boyhood
in England</i>. It is very laborious.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ he resumed, with nervous rapidity,
‘I have not confined myself to these. There
is “<i>What is Will?</i>” “<i>Mehitopel the Jewess

little fairy, Lady Constantia de la Pole:
such a charming child, and destined, I am
sure, to be a good and beautiful woman.
She is three years old, and shooting up
like a graceful young lily.’</p>

<p>“‘I fear I am detaining you,’ I said, as
the good man, whose eyes had filled with
tears during the last remark (he is a great
lover of children) pulled out a gold watch
and consulted its tell-tale dial. ‘Not at
all!,’ he replied with finished courtesy, ‘but
I always make a point of going in to High<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Tea and seeing my wife and family well
under weigh before I go off to Hall. Surely
that must be the gong, and there (as the
pleasant sound of children’s high voices
filled the house) come what I call my young
barbarians.’</p>

<p>“He accompanied me to the door with
true old-world politeness and shook me
beautifully by the hand. ‘Good-bye,’ he
said, ‘Good-bye and God-speed. You may
make what use you like of this, that I
believe the task of the journalist to be
among the noblest in our broad land. The
Press has a great mission, a great mission.’</p>

<p>“With these words still ringing in my
ears I gathered up my skirts to cross the
muddy roadway and stepped into the tram.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
